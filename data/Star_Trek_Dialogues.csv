Speaker,Dialogue
SPOCK,Check the circuit.
TYLER,"All operating, sir."
SPOCK,"It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there,"
TYLER,It could be these meteorites.
ONE,"No, it's something else. There's still something out there."
TYLER,"It's coming at the speed of light, collision course. The"
ONE,"Evasive manoeuvres, sir?"
PIKE,Steady as we go.
GARISON,"It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an old-style"
PIKE,They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this
GARISON,"A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's it. No"
TYLER,I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group.
ONE,We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.
SPOCK,Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia.
TYLER,It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to
SPOCK,Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar
ONE,"Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years."
PIKE,If they survived the crash.
SPOCK,"We aren't going to go, to be certain?"
PIKE,"Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega"
ONE,"Yes, sir."
PIKE,"Drop by my cabin, Doctor.  What's that? I"
BOYCE,I understand we picked up a distress signal.
PIKE,"That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it"
BOYCE,"Oh, I concur with yours, definitely."
PIKE,"Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the"
BOYCE,Who wants a warm martini?
PIKE,What makes you think I need one?
BOYCE,Sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell
PIKE,"Shouldn't it be? My only yeoman and two others dead, seven"
BOYCE,Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?
PIKE,"Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the"
BOYCE,"Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You"
re tired and youPIKE,You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for
BOYCE,"To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?"
PIKE,To the point of considering resigning.
BOYCE,And do what?
PIKE,"Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles"
BOYCE,"Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day."
PIKE,I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on
BOYCE,"You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?"
PIKE,The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole
BOYCE,"Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets"
PIKE,"Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender."
BOYCE,Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers.
GARISON, Eleven survivors from crash.
PIKE,Address intercraft.
TYLER,System open.
PIKE,This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group. Our
TYLER,Course computed and on the screen.
ONE,"All decks have acknowledged, sir."
PIKE,Engage.
TYLER,"On course, sir."
PIKE,Yeoman.
COLT,"Yes, sir."
PIKE,I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge
COLT,But you wanted the reports by oh five hundred. It's oh five
PIKE,"Oh, I see. Thank you."
ONE,"She's replacing your former yeoman, sir."
PIKE,"She does a good job, all right. It's just that I can't get used"
TYLER,"We've settled into orbit, sir."
GEOLOGIST,"Geological lab report complete, Captain."
SPOCK,"Preliminary lab survey ready, sir."
PIKE,Spectography?
GEOLOGIST,"Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy"
PIKE,Gravity?
GEOLOGIST,Zero point nine of Earth.
TYLER,"Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read"
PIKE,Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it?
SPOCK,"Yes, sir."
TYLER,"Yes, sir."
PIKE,"Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll"
ONE,"Of course, sir."
PIKE,"There's no indication of problems down there,"
PITCAIRN,"Yes, sir. There's a canyon to the left. We can set you there"
GARISON,Sir.
OLD MAN,They're men. They're humans.
PIKE,"Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise."
HASKINS,"Doctor Theodore Haskins, American Continent lnstitute."
SURVIVOR,Is Earth all right?
PIKE,"The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon."
TYLER,And you won't believe how fast you can get back. Well the time
HASKINS,This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we
PIKE, Enterprise.
PIKE,We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to
PIKE,That's affirmative on the
VINA,"You appear to be healthy and intelligent, Captain. A prime"
PIKE,"Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out."
HASKINS,"You must forgive her choice of words, Captain. She's lived her"
BOYCE,"If they can spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical"
VINA,I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.
BOYCE,Their health is excellent. Almost too good.
HASKINS,"There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt"
VINA,"You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon."
PIKE,I don't understand.
VINA,You will. You're a perfect choice.
TYLER,Captain!
SPOCK,Spock here.
SPOCK,"There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some"
PIKE,"Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the"
TALOSIAN,"It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen"
MAGISTRATE,This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so
PIKE,"You're not speaking, yet I can hear you."
MAGISTRATE,You will note the confusion as it reads our thought
PIKE,"All right then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read"
unless you want my ship to consider capturing me anunfriendly actMAGISTRATE,You now see the primitive fear threat reaction. The
PIKE,"If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these"
MAGISTRATE,"Despite its frustration, the creature appears more"
SPOCK,The inhabitants of this planet must live
ONE,"So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's
BOYCE,It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we
ONE,Any estimate what they might want one of us for?
SPOCK,"They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth"
TYLER,Then why aren't we doing anything? That entry may have stood up
SPOCK,Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing
TYLER,"It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help, and he probably"
ONE,Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power.
TALOSIAN,"Thousands of us are already probing the creature's thoughts,"
MAGISTRATE,I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it
VINA,"Come on, we must hide ourselves. Come, come."
PIKE,This is Rigel Seven.
VINA,"Please, we must hide ourselves."
PIKE,"I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be"
VINA,Come on.
PIKE,They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere
VINA,The killer!
PIKE,It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago. Except for you.
PIKE,"Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the"
VINA,Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.
PIKE,But it's only a dream.
VINA,You have to kill him as you did here before.
PIKE,You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an
VINA,"It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what"
PIKE,Why would an illusion be frightened?
VINA,Because that's the way you imagined me.
PIKE,Who are you? You act as if this were really you.
VINA,Careful.
VINA,It's over.
PIKE,Why are you here?
VINA,To please you.
PIKE,Are you real?
VINA,As real as you wish.
PIKE,"No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never met you before,"
VINA,Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.
PIKE,"What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear?"
VINA,"I have to wear something, don't I? I can wear whatever you wish,"
PIKE,So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how
VINA,"Don't you have a dream, something you've always wanted very badly?"
PIKE,"Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too?"
VINA,"You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any"
PIKE,"Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there"
VINA,You're a fool.
PIKE,"Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this"
ONE,"All circuits engaged, Mister Spock."
ONE,Take cover.
ONE,Increase to full power! Can you give us any more?
ONE,Disengage. The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the
BOYCE,Maybe it was. It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room.
VINA,"Perhaps if you asked me some questions, I"
PIKE,How far can they control my mind?
VINA,"If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let"
PIKE,Perhaps.
VINA,They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do.
PIKE,But they try to trick me with their illusions.
VINA,"And, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll"
PIKE,Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go
VINA,"War, thousands of centuries ago."
PIKE,That's why it's so barren up there?
PIKE,So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and
VINA,But they found it's a trap. Like a narcotic. Because when dreams
PIKE,Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.
VINA,You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion
PIKE,Which means they had to have more than one of each animal.
VINA,Please.
PIKE,They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to
VINA,You said that if I answered questions
PIKE,But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said
VINA,I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We're like Adam and
MAGISTRATE,The vial contains a nourishing protein complex.
PIKE,Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?
MAGISTRATE,"If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear"
PIKE,And if I prefer
MAGISTRATE,To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of
MAGISTRATE,From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now
PIKE,Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you
MAGISTRATE,"If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there"
PIKE,That's very interesting.
MAGISTRATE,Now to the female.
PIKE,You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?
MAGISTRATE,"As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our"
PIKE,"No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment"
MAGISTRATE,We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species
PIKE,Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through?
MAGISTRATE,It became necessary to attract a mate.
PIKE,"All right, all right, let's talk about the girl. You seem to be"
MAGISTRATE,This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species.
PIKE,It seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and
MAGISTRATE,We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.
PIKE,"Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So"
MAGISTRATE,With the female now properly conditioned.
PIKE,You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not co-operating!
MAGISTRATE,"First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy."
VINA,"You want some coffee, dear? I left the thermos hooked to my"
PIKE,"Tango! You old devil, you. I'm sorry I don't have any sugar."
VINA,"Hey, your coffee. Is it good to be home?"
PIKE,"They read our minds very well. Home, anything else I want, if I"
VINA,"Have you forgotten my headaches, darling? I get them when you"
PIKE,"Look, I'm sorry they punish you, but we can't let them"
VINA,"My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it?"
PIKE,It's funny. It's about twenty four hours ago I was telling the
VINA,I hope you're hungry. These little white sandwiches are your
PIKE,"You either live life, bruises, skinned knees and all, or you turn"
VINA,This is a lovely place to rest.
PIKE,I used to ride through here when I was a kid. It's not as pretty
VINA,Is that supposed to be news to your wife? You're home. You can
PIKE,"These headaches, they'll be hereditary you know. Would you wish"
VINA,Foolish.
PIKE,"Is it? Look, first they made me protect you and then feel"
VINA,They say in the olden days all this was a desert. Blowing sand
PIKE,"But we're not here, neither of us. We're in a menagerie, a cage!"
VINA,No.
VINA,Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?
PIKE,"Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our"
VINA,Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions. But you can't
PIKE,"Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like."
VINA,"But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my"
PIKE,"If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you."
TALOSIAN,A curious species. They have fantasies they hide even from
OFFICER,"Nice place you have here, Mister Pike."
PIKE,Vina?
ORION,Glistening green. Almost like secret dreams a bored ship captain
OFFICER,Funny how they are on this planet. They actually like being
ORION,Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?
SPOCK,We've located a magnetic field that seems to
GARISON,Could that be an illusion too?
ONE,"Now, you all know the situation. We're hoping to transport down"
SPOCK,"If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could"
ONE,Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out.
SPOCK,The women!
ONE,Captain! Captain.
VINA,No! Let me finish!
ONE,But we were a party of six.
COLT,We were the only ones transported.
VINA,It's not fair. You don't need them.
PIKE, They don't work.
ONE,They were fully charged when we left. It's dead.  I
PIKE,Don't say anything. I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating
VINA,"How long can you block your thoughts? A few minutes, an hour? How"
COLT,Leave him alone.
VINA,He doesn't need you. He's already picked me.
COLT,Picked her? For what? I don't understand.
VINA,"Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring."
COLT,"Offspring, as in children?"
ONE,Offspring as in he's Adam. Is that it?
VINA,You're no better choice. They'd have more luck crossing him with
ONE,"Well, shall we do a little time computation? There was a Vina"
VINA,It's not fair. I did what you asked.
MAGISTRATE,"Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a"
PIKE,I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you. Is your blood
MAGISTRATE,Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour.
PIKE,All I want to do is get my hands on you. Can you read these
MAGISTRATE,The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but
PIKE,You'll find my thoughts more interesting. Thoughts so primitive
MAGISTRATE,Wrong thinking is punishable. Right thinking will be as
ONE,Captain.
PIKE,"No. No, don't help me. I have to concentrate. They can't read"
SPOCK,Address intercraft.
GARISON,"Open, sir."
SPOCK,This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but
TYLER,"Mister Spock, the ship's controls have gone dead."
SPOCK,Engine room!
GARISON,Open.
SPOCK,Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out.
TYLER,There's nothing. Every system aboard is fading out.
PIKE,"Now you hold still, or I'll break your neck."
VINA,Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil.
PIKE,I've had some samples of how good they are.
PIKE,"You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off. "
MAGISTRATE,Your ship. Release me or we'll destroy it.
SPOCK,Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen.
TYLER,The computers!
TYLER,"I can't shut it off. It's running through our library. Tapes,"
SPOCK,Could be we've waited too long. It's collecting all the
VINA,"He's not bluffing, Captain. With illusion"
PIKE,I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason
PIKE,"On the other hand, I've got a reason. I'm willing to bet you've"
COLT,Captain.
PIKE,"Make contact, Number One."
ONE,"They kept us from seeing this, too. We cut through and never knew"
MAGISTRATE,"As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing."
PIKE,I want to contact our ship.
MAGISTRATE,You are now on the surface where we wished you to be. With
PIKE,And start by burying you?
MAGISTRATE,That is your choice. To help you reclaim the planet's
PIKE,"Look, I'll make a deal with you. You and your life for the lives"
MAGISTRATE,"Since our lifespan is many times yours, we have time to"
technicians PIKE,Do you understand what I'm saying? You give me proof that our
ONE,It's wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves.
MAGISTRATE,Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves?
VINA,What is that?
PIKE,The weapon is building up an overload. A force chamber explosion.
VINA,"If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go either."
PIKE,Wait.
TALOSIAN,Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much
MAGISTRATE,We had not believed this possible. The customs and history
VINA,He means that they can't use you. You're free to go back to the
PIKE,"And that's it? No apologies? You captured one of us, threatened"
TALOSIAN,Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to
MAGISTRATE,No other specimen has shown your adaptability. You were our
PIKE,"But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual co-operation?"
MAGISTRATE,Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy
ONE,"Captain, we have transporter control now."
PIKE,Let's get back to the ship.
VINA,I can't. I can't go with you.
PITCAIRN,"Sir, it just came on. We can't shut the"
SPOCK,Mister Spock here.
GARISON,The captain?
VINA,You see why I can't go with you.
MAGISTRATE,This is the female's true appearance.
VINA,"They found me in the wreckage, dying. A lump of flesh. They"
MAGISTRATE,It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an
PIKE,You'll give her back her illusion of beauty?
MAGISTRATE,And more.
MAGISTRATE,She has an illusion and you have reality. May you find your
PITCAIRN,"Mister Spock, the system is coming on"
COLT,What's happened to Vina?
ONE,Isn't she coming with us?
PIKE,"No. No, and I agreed with her reasons."
BOYCE,Hold on a minute.
PIKE,"Oh, I feel fine, just fine."
BOYCE,You look a hundred percent better.
PIKE,"You recommended a rest, a change of pace, didn't you? I've even"
PIKE,Yeoman.
COLT,"Yes, sir."
PIKE,I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge I
PIKE,Oh. Oh yes. The reports. Thank you.
COLT,"Sir, I was wondering. Just curious. Who would have been Eve?"
ONE,Yeoman! You've delivered your report.
COLT,"Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir."
TYLER,"Eve, sir? Yes, sir."
BOYCE,Eve as in Adam?
PIKE,As in all ship's doctors are dirty old men. What are we running

PIKE,Engage.
Original Airdate,"8 Sep, 1966"

MCCOY,"Is that how you get girls to like you, by bribing them? There"

NANCY,Let me look at you.

MCCOY,And Crewman Darnell.
DARNELL," How do you do, ma'am?"
KIRK,"Something wrong, Darnell?"
DARNELL,"Excuse me sir but, ma'am, if I didn't know better I would"
re exactly like a girl that MCCOY,"A little less mouth, Darnell."
DARNELL,"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I mean, I know it's impossible,"
KIRK,"Why don't you step outside, Darnell."
DARNELL,"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."
KIRK,"Maybe I'll step outside, too."
NANCY,What? And let Plum examine me all alone?
KIRK,Plum?
MCCOY,Plum.
NANCY,A nickname I gave Leonard when we were very young.
MCCOY,"I'll, er, I'll wait for the professor and I'll catch you both at"

CRATER,The heroic Captain and the intrepid doctor cross interstellar
MCCOY,I'm pleased you're doing well but I'm required to confirm that
CRATER,Doubtless the good surgeon will enjoy prodding and poking us
MCCOY,What you want is unimportant right now. What you will get is
KIRK,Quote. All research personnel on alien planets are required to

KIRK,"He's all yours, Plum. Doctor McCoy."
MCCOY,"Sit down and breathe deeply, please."
CRATER,Did I hear you call him Doctor McCoy?
MCCOY,You did.
CRATER,McCoy. I've heard Nancy speak of a Doctor McCoy.
MCCOY,That's me. Didn't she mention I was here?
CRATER,You've seen Nancy?
KIRK,She went out to get you.
CRATER,You've seen her too? You were with the good Doctor?
KIRK,Yes. Why?
CRATER,Nothing. It's just that it gives me pleasure to know that she's
MCCOY,"Well, it certainly hasn't aged her. She looks exactly as I knew"
CRATER,"Sorry. I'm sorry, Captain, sit down. I seem to have forgotten"
KIRK,Quite all right.
MCCOY,"I'm not joking, Jim. She hasn't aged a day. She doesn't have a"

CRATER,"You've seen my wife with the eyes of your past attachment,"
MCCOY,Well at any rate she doesn't look a day over thirty.

MCCOY,Open your mouth.
CRATER,"Why, I thought the machine"
MCCOY,The machine is capable of almost anything but I'll still put my
KIRK, McCoy.
MCCOY,"Dead, Jim. Strange. A red mottling all over his face."
KIRK,What happened?
CRATER,"What do you suppose happened, Captain? You beam down a crewman"
KIRK,"I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater. I want to know what"
NANCY,"Well, I, I"
MCCOY,"Take it easy, Nancy. Just tell us what you know."
NANCY,"I was just. I couldn't find Bob, and I was coming back. I"
MCCOY,"No, no, no, no, it's not that. It's something entirely"
CRATER,"We don't need an examination, you can see that. Perhaps you'd"
better take your man and KIRK,"We're well aware of our next duties, Professor. We'll complete"
KIRK,Lock onto us. Three beaming up.
NANCY,Salt. You did ask them about more salt tablets?
CRATER,"I'll take care of the provisioning, Nancy."
SPOCK,"Miss Uhura, your last sub-space log contained an error in the"
UHURA,"Mister Spock, sometimes I think if I hear that word frequency"
SPOCK,Cry?
UHURA,I was just trying to start a conversation.
SPOCK,"Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to"
UHURA,"No, you have an answer. I'm an illogical woman who's beginning"
SPOCK,"Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura."
UHURA,"I'm not surprised, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Bridge acknowledging.
UHURA,I don't believe it.
SPOCK,Explain.
UHURA,You explain. That means that somebody is dead and you just sit
SPOCK,"Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what"
MCCOY,She called it a Borgia plant.
KIRK,Something new to me.
KIRK,"Go ahead, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,"Hmm. Well then, this man wasn't poisoned."
KIRK,"Stand by, Mister Spock. She said she saw him eat the plant."
MCCOY,"She's mistaken. I know alkaloid poison, what to look for."
KIRK,There were bits of the plant in his mouth.
MCCOY,"Jim, don't tell me my business. He could not have swallowed any."
KIRK,Then what kills a healthy man
MCCOY,I'll tell you something else. This man shouldn't be dead. I
KIRK,"How your lost love affects your vision, Doctor, doesn't interest"
MCCOY,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Message, Captain. Starship base on Caran 4 requesting"
UHURA,"Got it, Captain."
KIRK,Well?
SPOCK,No mistake in our record tapes. Borgia plant. Its sole deadly
KIRK,And Professor Crater and wife?
SPOCK,Check out perfectly. They arrived here nearly five years ago.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,What is it?
MCCOY,I'd rather not put it on the speaker.
SPOCK,Fascinating.
MCCOY,So improbable we almost didn't check it.
KIRK,What?
SPOCK,Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it.
MCCOY,This man has no salt in his body at all.
KIRK,"Can you explain that, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"I can't, except that what we normally carry in our bodies is"
SPOCK,He would die almost instantly.
KIRK,How? There isn't a mark on his body.
MCCOY,Except the red rings on his face.
KIRK,You called that skin mottling.
MCCOY,"I thought it was, sir. Another error on my part."
KIRK,"I'm not counting them, Bones. Are you in the mood for an apology?"
MCCOY,"Oh, forget it. I probably was mooning over her. I should have"
KIRK,Perhaps you were. Both Nancy and Crater went out of their way to
MCCOY,Salt tablets.
KIRK,"Mister Spock, outfit a landing party. We're beaming down with"
CRATER,One might think that you had more important duties than
KIRK,"I have, Professor. Believe me, I have. Where is Mrs. Crater? I"
CRATER,"Captain, you can't just beam down here and bully us, and"
KIRK,Mrs. Crater. I won't ask again.
CRATER,Possibly at the other diggings. We don't keep military logs
KIRK,"Green, find her."
GREEN,"Yes, sir. "
KIRK,Mister Spock.
KIRK,"Sturgeon, transport a sample of the plant to Mister Spock. We'll"
CRATER,"Captain, considering the inescapable fact that you are a"
trespasser on my planet KIRK,"Your complaint is noted, sir. Look, something we don't understand"
CRATER,We've been here for almost five years. If there were anything
KIRK,"Bones, tell the professor what the autopsy revealed."
MCCOY,"Our crewman died of salt depletion. Sudden, total loss of it."
KIRK,"And by coincidence, both you and Mrs. Crater requested salt"
CRATER,And your esteemed physician cannot explain our need for salt
KIRK,We're all aware of the need for salt on a hot and arid planet
CRATER, Nancy and I started with twenty five
MCCOY, Salt.
KIRK,One of the missions of the Enterprise is to protect human life in
CRATER,But you can't do that.
KIRK,"But I can, Professor."
KIRK,Arrange quarters for Professor and Mrs. Crater. Did you get the
MCCOY,"Jim, he's run off."
CRATER,"Nancy! You! Salt! I've got salt! Smell it! Smell it, Nancy!"
KIRK,Professor Crater! Professor! Professor!
MCCOY,"Jim! Jim, it's Sturgeon. He's dead."
KIRK,"We'd better locate Crewman Green. Green! Green! Crewman Green,"
MCCOY,"Crewman Green, report! Green! Green, where are you? Could it be"
KIRK,I don't know. Green!  Did you see this?
GREEN,"Yes, sir. Sturgeon was dead when I found him. I was circling to"
MCCOY,"Same red rings on his face. Have you seen Nancy, Mrs. Crater?"
GREEN,"No, sir. I checked all through the ruins."
MCCOY,"I'm worried about her, Jim. She's not at the quarters, she's not"
KIRK,Crater!
MCCOY,"Nancy, it's Leonard!"
KIRK,"We're beaming aboard the ship, Doctor."
MCCOY,You can't leave her!
KIRK,We can't search this whole planet on foot.
MCCOY,Jim!
KIRK,"You could learn something from Mister Spock, Doctor. Stop"
KIRK,Kirk to Bridge.
KIRK,Break out the surface search equipment. I want co-ordinates on
KIRK,There's a body down there. Sturgeon.
TRANSPORTER OPERATOR,"We'll bring him home, sir."
KIRK,"You could use some sleep, Bones."
MCCOY,"All right, Jim."
KIRK,Bridge.
RAND,"Oh, Green, what went on down there? (he reaches for the salt"
SPOCK,"Something odd, Captain. You said two people."
KIRK,Professor and Nancy Crater.
SPOCK,"We get a reading on only one person, probably Crater. He's"
KIRK,Expand search radius.
SPOCK,"Yes, sir."
RAND,Why don't you go chase an asteroid?
REDSHIRT,"Hey, Janice, is that for me?"
RAND,Don't you wish it was?
BLUESHIRT,How about that?
REDSHIRT,"Yeah, how'd you like to have her as your personal yeoman?"
RAND,"Where are you, Sulu?"
SULU,"In here feeding the weepers, Janice."
RAND,I've got your tray.
SULU,May the Great Bird of the Galaxy bless your planet.
RAND,"Thank you. Hello, Beauregard. How are you today, darling?"
SULU,Her name's Gertrude.
RAND,"No, it's a he plant. A girl can tell."
SULU,"Why do people have to call inanimate objects she, like she's a"
RAND,He is not an inanimate object. He's so animate he makes me
SULU,"Hello, Green."
RAND,He's not talking today. You been nipping saurian brandy or
SULU, Take it easy. Calm down. Very sensitive.
RAND,He's the real spook. Suppose he's going space happy or something?
CREWMAN,"In a way, ma'am. You were just thinking of someone like me."
UHURA,"I see. So naturally, when I'm lonely I think of you."
CREWMAN,Ina cuvanea mwanamke turee.
UHURA,Una kafeeri Hur. You're Swahili?
RAND,"I'd better get this tray back. Bye, Beauregard."
SULU,"Wait a minute, I'll walk along."
UHURA,"Lieutenant Uhura. On my way, sir."
MCCOY,McCoy to Bridge. Captain there?
MCCOY,Nope.
SPOCK,The simple fact is unless there's something seriously wrong with
KIRK,All right. We'll triangulate on him. We'll let Professor Crater
UHURA,"Yes, Captain."
MCCOY,"Nancy. Well, come in. come in. I've been worried sick about you."
NANCY,"I'm so happy to see you, Leonard. The others, they, I, I don't"
MCCOY,Well.
NANCY,"You do care, don't you, Leonard? It makes me feel so, so safe."
MCCOY,"Nancy, er"
NANCY,My husband? I like your feelings better. Much stronger. But
MCCOY,You're as bad as Jim Kirk. He's been telling me to take these.
NANCY,I think you should. I'll get you some water.
RAND,Look at his face!
SULU,"Bridge. Sulu. Trouble on deck nine, section two. We need a"
MCCOY," I was so worried. Your husband acting strange,"
NANCY,"You're so tired, darling. Just rest now."
NANCY,"It's nothing, dear. It's nothing. You just sleep. Nancy will"
KIRK,Professor Crater.
CRATER,Go away! We don't want you here.
KIRK,"We? Where's your wife, Professor? We're concerned about her."
CRATER,I'm armed. Go away.
KIRK,"Where's your wife, Professor?"
CRATER,She's no concern of yours.
KIRK,"We're worried about her safety. Aren't you? Professor, you're a"
SPOCK,"Spock cutting in, Captain. Something here, through the arches to"
KIRK,"Stand by, Mister Sulu. Spock has something."
SPOCK,Green.
KIRK,He beamed up to the ship with us.
SPOCK,Or something did.
KIRK,Enterprise from Kirk.
KIRK,You have an intruder aboard. Could be masquerading as Crewman
SPOCK,Crater knows the creature. If we could take him alive.
KIRK,"Negative, Lieutenant, but keep locked in on us. Kirk out. Let's"
CRATER,We don't want you here! We're happy alone! I'll kill to stay
SPOCK,"Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult."
KIRK,Set your phaser on one quarter. I'll leave mine on stun.
SPOCK,Why risk your life for his?
KIRK,"He's not trying to kill us, he's trying to frighten us, and he's"
SULU,"GQ three now secured except for decks five, seven, and ten. Come"
UHURA,He's not in supply and maintenance.
SULU,Go to Engineering now. Run through file photos of the crewmen
UHURA,Check.
No one has seen him SULU,"Keep in mind if you find him, he's not Crewman Green. The Captain"
RAND,"And he, or rather it, followed me. I thought there was something"
SULU,"He, whatever, was probably your crewman, too, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"He must have been it. You know, I would have remembered a"
MCCOY,"The creature leading you a merry chase, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,The creature?
MCCOY,Or whatever it is that's killing the crewmen. Perhaps I can
KIRK,Set.
SPOCK,Acknowledged. Crater! 
KIRK,"Your wife, Professor. Where is she? Your wife, Professor. Where"
CRATER,She was the last of her kind.
KIRK,The last of her kind?
CRATER,"The last of its kind. Earth history, remember? Like the"
KIRK,Just stunned. You'll be able to think in a minute.
SPOCK,The Earth buffalo. What about it?
CRATER,Once there were millions of them prairies black with them. One
SPOCK,And now they're gone. Is that what you mean?
CRATER,Like the creatures here. Once there were millions of them. Now
SPOCK,Always in the past tense.
KIRK,Where's your wife? Where is she now?
CRATER,Dead. Buried up on the hill. It killed her.
KIRK,When?
CRATER,"Oh, a year, or was it two?"
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"It's definite, Mister Sulu. The intruder can assume any shape."
KIRK,Go to GQ four.
CRATER,"The creature was trying to survive. It has that right, doesn't"
KIRK,Kirk to transporter room. Three to beam up.
CRATER,They needed salt to stay alive. There was no more salt. It's
KIRK,"There's one, Professor. Your creature is killing my people."
SECURITY,Security 3 A here. 3 B in sight.
UHURA,"Negative, Captain. I've checked every face on this vessel. It"
KIRK,"Yeoman Rand, how long was this Green with you?"
RAND,"As long as he, it thought it could get to the salt on my tray,"
KIRK,Mister Spock?
SPOCK,Supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and
KIRK,Dr. McCoy?
MCCOY,Yes?
KIRK,"Medical department report, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Oh. Well, we could offer it salt without tricks. There's no"
SPOCK,"Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is"
CRATER, The creature is not dangerous when
MCCOY,"No, it's simply trying to survive by using its natural ability"
CRATER,"The way the chameleon uses its protective colouring, an ability"
MCCOY,"And like us, it's an intelligent animal. There's no need to hunt"
SPOCK,"A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor. Briefing room."
KIRK,"Thank you, Lieutenant. Continue the search. Crater, we don't know"
CRATER,"I demanded, I even begged that you get off my planet."
KIRK,"Can you recognise this thing When you see it? Professor, I'll"
CRATER,I loved Nancy very much. Few women like my Nancy. She lives in
KIRK,And it becomes Nancy for you.
CRATER,Not because of tricks. It doesn't trick me. It needs love as
KIRK,"You bleed too much, Crater. You're too pure and noble. Are you"
CRATER,You don't understand.
KIRK,Have you learned to see this thing in whatever form it becomes?
CRATER,Yes.
KIRK,Are you going to help us find it?
CRATER,"Sorry, I can't."
SPOCK,"Recommend we use truth serum, Captain."
KIRK,Doctor?
MCCOY,"Well, I resist using it, but in this case the professor will"
KIRK,Take him.
SPOCK,"I'll accompany you, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Oh, yes. Of course."
SPOCK, It wasn't McCoy. It was the creature. It hit me.
RAND,Captain. Professor Crater.
KIRK,"Dead. But it had you, too."
SPOCK,"Fortunately, my ancestors spawned in another ocean than yours"
NANCY,"Leonard. Leonard, wake up. Please help me. Help me, Leonard."
MCCOY,"Easy, easy. Nobodies going to"
NANCY,But you must help me!
KIRK,"Move aside, Bones."
MCCOY,"What's going on here, Jim?"
KIRK,"She's not Nancy, Bones."
MCCOY,Are you insane?
KIRK,It killed four crewmen. Now Crater.
MCCOY,It?
KIRK,"The creature. It kills. It needs salt to live. Bones, move aside."
MCCOY,No!
KIRK,"My guess is she needs more. You want it, Nancy? Come and get it."
MCCOY,"You're frightening her, Jim."
KIRK,Not fright. Hunger. Look at her.
NANCY,"Leonard, if you love me, make him go away."
KIRK,"Come on. You want this, Nancy? Come on Nancy. Come and get it."
NANCY,"Leonard, help me."
MCCOY,"Stop it, Jim!"
KIRK,"McCoy, get out of the way!"
MCCOY,Are you out of your mind?
KIRK,Get out of the way. (McCoy and Kirk struggle for the phaser while
SPOCK,"It's killing the Captain. Shoot it, Doctor, quickly!"
MCCOY,No! No! 
MCCOY,I won't shoot Nancy.
SPOCK,"This is not Nancy.  If she were Nancy,"
MCCOY,"Stop it! Stop it, Spock! Stop it! (Nancy sends Spock flying with"
SPOCK,"Is that Nancy, Doctor?"
MCCOY,No.  No! (She transforms into her
NANCY,"Leonard. Leonard, no. Leonard, please."
MCCOY,"Lord, forgive me. "
KIRK,"I'm sorry, Bones."
SULU,"Ready to leave orbit, Captain."
SPOCK,"Something wrong, Captain?"
KIRK,"I was thinking about the buffalo, Mister Spock. Warp one, Mister"
SULU,"Warp one, sir. Leaving orbit."
Original Airdate,"15 Sep, 1966"
KIRK,"All right, Chief, begin materialisation."
RAMART,This is my navigator Tom Nellis.
KIRK,How do you do?
NELLIS,How do you do?
RAMART,"And this is our young castaway Charlie, Charlie Evans. His"
KIRK,Mister Evans. We've heard a great deal about you. Welcome aboard.
RAMART,"Wonderful boy, Charlie. Its been an honour having him aboard."
NELLIS,"Why, it's been a great pleasure. The things that he's learned"
in the last RAMART,Absolutely. To think this boy spent practically his whole life
CHARLIE,How many humans like me on this ship?
RAMART,"Like a whole city in space, Charlie. Over four hundred in the"
KIRK,"Four hundred and twenty eight, to be exact. Is there anything we"
CHARLIE,"Hundreds. All human, like me. That's exciting. Is that the"
NELLIS,That's perfect. It's the exact word.
RAMART,"You see. We'd like to keep Charlie with us, but with his"
why CHARLIE,I'd like to see your ship now. All of it. The people and
KIRK,"You keep interrupting, Mister Evans. That's considered wrong."
CHARLIE,I'm sorry.
KIRK,"We have a large supply of entertainment tapes, gentlemen."
RAMART,"No, we've a tight schedule to make, Captain. Just twenty of us,"
KIRK,This must be a space first. A transport ship that doesn't need
RAMART,Nothing.
KIRK,Not even Sarian brandy?
RAMART,"We're fine, thank you. Pleasant journey, Captain."
KIRK,Thank you. 
KIRK,"Yeoman Rand, this is Charles Evans. Show him to his quarters and"
RAND,"Yes, sir. Come with me, please."
CHARLIE,Are you a girl? Is that a girl?
KIRK,That's a girl.
MCCOY,Tell me. The ship's supply of food
CHARLIE,"After that I found other things to eat, just growing around."
MCCOY,And you learned to talk by just listening to the ship's tapes?
CHARLIE,"The memory banks still worked. They talked to me, and I talked"
MCCOY,You're four-oh.
CHARLIE,Four?
MCCOY,Four-oh. One hundred percent. Sound of wind and limb.
CHARLIE,"That, that Captain. Kirk?"
MCCOY,Yeah.
CHARLIE,Why does he call me Mister Evans?
MCCOY,Because that's your name.
CHARLIE,"He's not, well, he isn't like Captain Ramart."
MCCOY,"Well, no. Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie."
CHARLIE,Do you like me?
MCCOY,Why not?
CHARLIE,"Some, the other ship, they didn't like me. I tried. I'm trying"
MCCOY,"Most seventeen year olds do. Come on, let's go. I'll show you to"
CHARLIE,I brought you a present.
RAND,"Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it, but, but I have to go. I'm"
CHARLIE,Do you like that kind?
RAND,"Yes, I, it's my favourite. Where did you get it? They don't have"
CHARLIE,It's a present.
RAND,"I know, but where did? Gee, I'm late, Charlie. I really have to"
CHARLIE,Can't you stay and talk a little while?
RAND,"Look, I'm off duty at fourteen hundred. Why don't you join me in"
CHARLIE,"You got a deal, friend. "
RAND,Charlie!
CHARLIE,"I thought. Don't be angry. I didn't, I wanted."
RAND,"Charlie, you, you, you just don't go around slapping girls on"
CHARLIE,Don't be angry.
RAND,"Look, why don't you tell Captain Kirk or Doctor McCoy what you"
CHARLIE,I will.
RAND,Okay.
MCCOY,"But tell me, what reason would he have to"
SPOCK,That is a very intriguing question. Scanners show no
KIRK,"Good. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock is working out"
UHURA,"Excuse me, Captain. Status report."
KIRK,Thank you. He's working out a training programme for Charlie
MCCOY,"Well, don't you think it'd be better for a strong father image"
KIRK,"The job is yours, Bones. Flattery will get you nowhere."
SPOCK,"Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians?"
KIRK,"Do you believe the legend, Mister Spock, that Thasians still"
SPOCK,Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some
MCCOY,"By which time he would have been eating fruits, vegetables."
SPOCK,Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life.
MCCOY,"And probes have been known to be wrong, Spock."
MCCOY,"Doctor, are you speaking scientifically or emotionally?"
KIRK,"Gentlemen, the fact is the boy is here and he's alive and he"
MCCOY,"And he needs a guide and he needs a father image, Jim."
KIRK,Hmm. I'll depend on your astute abilities to supply him with
UHURA,"I'm sorry. I did it again, didn't I."
UHURA," Oh, on the starship Enterprise"
RAND,One more time!
UHURA," Now from a planet out in space, there comes a lad, not"
CHARLIE,Want to see something?  Turn them
RAND,"Well, how did you do that?"
CHARLIE,"Oh, I can do a lot of card tricks. One of the men on the"
RAND,I don't believe this!
KIRK,"On Earth today, it's Thanksgiving. If the"
CHARLIE,Captain? I'm supposed to ask you something. Why shouldn't I? I
KIRK,"Say it right out, Charlie. That usually works."
CHARLIE,"Well, in the corridor I saw. When Janice, when Yeoman Rand"
KIRK,"Me. I see. Well, um, er, there are things you can do with a lady,"
CHARLIE,I don't know.
KIRK,Excuse me. Kirk here.
KIRK,I'm on my way to the Bridge now.
CHARLIE,Can I come with you?
KIRK,"I don't think so, Charlie."
CHARLIE,I won't get in the way.
KIRK,Okay.
UHURA,"Can you boost your power, Antares. We're"
KIRK,"Kirk here, Captain Ramart."
ve got to warn KIRK,Re-establish contact.
UHURA,They're not transmitting.
KIRK,Keep trying.
CHARLIE,It wasn't very well constructed.
KIRK,Sweep the area of the Antares transmission with our probe
SPOCK,"Affirmative, Captain."
KIRK,"You think something happened to the Antares, Charlie?"
CHARLIE,I don't know.
SPOCK,"Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain."
KIRK,What about the Antares?
SPOCK,The debris is what's left of the Antares.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,"Chief, have you been"
SPOCK,"Your mind is not on the game, Captain. Check. The Antares?"
KIRK,"A survey ship with twenty men aboard lost. No reason. Obviously,"
SPOCK,My own concern is more immediate. The boy.
KIRK,"I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time?"
SPOCK,He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did.
KIRK,"I'd call it a pretty long reach for evidence, Mister Spock. Come"
SPOCK,"And again, check."
KIRK,Checkmate.
SPOCK,Your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on
KIRK,I prefer to call it inspired.
SPOCK,"As you wish. At any rate, the game is yours."
KIRK,"You play chess, Charlie?"
CHARLIE,"Oh, I, I watched them play on the Antares. Can I try?"
KIRK,I place you in the hands of our chess master.
SPOCK,The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically
CHARLIE,I know what it is. Let's play.
SPOCK,"Very well.  That was a mistake, Charlie."
CHARLIE,"No, it wasn't."
SPOCK,Checkmate.
CHARLIE,"No, it isn't."
SPOCK,If you'll excuse me.
RAND,"Oh, Charlie. I was looking for you. I'd like"
TINA,"Hello, Charlie."
RAND,I thought you might enjoy meeting someone your own age.
CHARLIE,"Can I talk to you, alone."
RAND,"Charlie, Tina's"
TINA,Excuse me. I must be wanted somewhere.
RAND,"That was, that was rude and completely uncalled-for."
CHARLIE,But I don't need her. I want to talk to you.
RAND,That's no excuse. You'd better learn that right now. You have to
CHARLIE,But she's not as. She doesn't. She's not the same. Not like
KIRK,What?
RAND,"I wasn't sure I should, er, talk to you about this."
KIRK,Charlie's a seventeen year old boy.
RAND,"Exactly, and he's"
KIRK,I talked to him about the swat.
RAND,"It's not that. Captain, I've seen the look before, and if"
and his first KIRK,"Yes, Yeoman, I'll talk to him. I'll look into it."
RAND,"Thank you, sir."
KIRK,"Come in, Charlie. Er, Charlie. Charlie, do"
CHARLIE,"No, sir. Is that all?"
KIRK,"Er, no. No, no. Sit down. Charlie, being seventeen is more than"
CHARLIE,"Oh, I won't hit her like that anymore."
KIRK,"No, there's more to it than that."
CHARLIE,"Everything I do or say is wrong. I'm in the way, I don't know"
KIRK,"Now wait, wait."
CHARLIE,"I don't know what I am or what I'm supposed to be, or even"
KIRK,"You'll live, believe me. There's nothing wrong with you that"
CHARLIE,What if you care for someone? What do you do?
KIRK,"You go slow. You be gentle. I mean, it's not a one-way street,"
CHARLIE,You don't think Janice. You. She could love me!
KIRK,"She's not the girl, Charlie. The years are wrong, for one thing,"
CHARLIE,She can.
KIRK,"No, Charlie."
CHARLIE,She is.
KIRK,No.
CHARLIE,But if I did what you said! If I was gentle!
KIRK,"Charlie, there are a million things in this universe you can have"
CHARLIE,Then what am I going to do?
KIRK,Hang on tight and survive. Everybody does.
CHARLIE,You don't.
KIRK,"Everybody, Charlie. Me, too."
CHARLIE,"I'm trying, but I don't know how."
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,"Ask Mister Spock to see to it. Charlie, come on with me."
KIRK,You've got to slap the floor to absorb the
CHARLIE,I don't want to do that.
KIRK,"Well, it makes it hard to teach you"
CHARLIE,I don't want to do that.
KIRK,"All right, Charlie. Lesson's over for today."
CHARLIE,You were going to teach me how to fight.
KIRK,You have to learn to protect yourself in a fall before I do that.
SAM,Right.
KIRK,"Watch this, Charlie. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now I'll throw"
CHARLIE,That looks hard.
SAM,Oh.
KIRK,"Come on, Charlie. Try it. Attaboy. Let's go."
CHARLIE,Oh!
KIRK,"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
CHARLIE,Don't laugh at me.
KIRK,Cool off.
CHARLIE,Don't laugh at me!
KIRK,Charlie.
CHARLIE,He shouldn't have done that. It's not nice to laugh at people.
KIRK,"What happened to him, Charlie?"
CHARLIE,He's gone.
KIRK,That's no answer.
CHARLIE,He's gone! I didn't mean to do that. He made me do it! He
KIRK,"Kirk here. Two men from security, on the double."
CHARLIE,What are you going to do to me?
KIRK,I'm confining you to quarters. I want you to stay there.
CHARLIE,"I won't let them hurt me. I'll make them go away, too."
KIRK,"They won't hurt you, Charlie.  They'll take you"
CHARLIE,No! 
KIRK,Go to your quarters.
CHARLIE,He was going to hurt me.
KIRK,Go to your quarters or I'll pick you up and carry you there.
CHARLIE,I won't let you.
KIRK,"That's your choice, Charlie."
CHARLIE,I won't let them hurt me.
KIRK,They won't hurt you.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,"No, I heard you. Have Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock meet me in"
SPOCK,Thasians have been referred to in our
KIRK,"What are chances that Charlie's not an Earthling, that he's a"
MCCOY,"No, I don't think so, not unless they're exactly like"
SPOCK,Agreed.
KIRK,"Well, whatever he is, we have some idea of the power he has. I"
MCCOY,"Considering the effect a normal adolescent has on a home,"
Charlie with the power he has KIRK,"Short-tempered, because he doesn't understand. He needs, he"
SPOCK,The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the
KIRK,He doesn't understand what life is. He's a boy.
MCCOY,"Well, what do we do with this boy, Jim? How do we keep him caged"
KIRK,"It goes even further than that, Doctor. We can't take him with us"
SPOCK,"And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone,"
MCCOY,"Well, for the moment he's stopped. You're an authority he"
SPOCK,Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him. Should any
CHARLIE,"You wanted to ask me something, he said."
KIRK,"Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie?"
CHARLIE,Why?
KIRK,Answer me.
CHARLIE,Yes. There was a warped baffle-plate on the shield of their
KIRK,"What about us, Charlie?"
CHARLIE,I don't know.
SPOCK,We're in the hands of an adolescent.
KIRK,"Lieutenant, raise Colony Five. I want to"
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Navigator, lay a course away from Colony Five. Buy me some time."
NAVIGATOR,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Spock, get the doctor up here on the double. How bad is it?"
UHURA,"I think it's all right, sir. Sir, there's no reason for that"
NAVIGATOR,Captain! I can't feed any course co-ordinates into the
PILOT,"Helm doesn't respond either, sir. "
KIRK,"Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments?"
SPOCK,"Yes, sir. There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest"
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,"I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's"
CHARLIE,"You're trying to change course, Captain. You can't do that. I"
KIRK,Release the transmitter.
CHARLIE,You don't need all that subspace chatter.
MCCOY,What's going on here? Spock calls me to the Bridge and goes into
KIRK,"See to her, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary."
CHARLIE,"Very nice, Mister Ears. Oh, I can make him do anything, whirl"
KIRK,"That's enough, Charlie."
CHARLIE,Don't you think he's funny? I think he's funny.
KIRK,Leave my crew alone. 
SPOCK,"Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down."
KIRK,I know.
TINA,"Charlie, what's wrong? (he turns her into an"
CHARLIE,I have something for you.  Pink is
RAND,You don't walk into a room without knocking.
CHARLIE,"Don't ever lock your door on me again, Janice. I love you."
RAND,"I'll lock it when I please. What is it you want, anyway?"
CHARLIE,You. I only want to be nice to you. I can give you anything.
RAND, I want you to get out.
KIRK,Spock.
CHARLIE,I love you.
RAND,You don't know what the word means.
CHARLIE,Then show me.
RAND,No!
RAND,Charlie!
CHARLIE,"Why did she do that? I loved her, but she wasn't nice at all."
KIRK,Mister Spock?
SPOCK,My legs. They're broken.
KIRK,"Let him go, too, Charlie."
CHARLIE,Why?
KIRK,"Because I'm telling you to. Because you need me to run the ship,"
CHARLIE,"If you try to hurt me again, I'll make a lot of people go"
KIRK,And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed?
CHARLIE,"I won't tell you. Growing up isn't so much. I'm not a man, and"
SPOCK,I'll activate the force field myself. You
CHARLIE,He had a mean look. I had to freeze him. I like happy looks.
CHARLIE,That wasn't
CHARLIE,No. No laughing!
UHURA,"Captain Kirk, my instruments show we're"
KIRK,"Are you creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one"
CHARLIE,"It's my game, Captain. You have to find out. Like you said,"
KIRK,I've waited long enough. I'm going to take him on.
MCCOY,You don't have any special immunity. Not anymore. Pushed far
KIRK,Mister Spock?
SPOCK,Out of the question.
KIRK,"Wait a minute. Does Charlie? Now, wait, Spock, has he done away"
SPOCK,Not so far as we know.
KIRK,Maybe he can't. Could be he's overreached himself. It's a big
MCCOY,"Risky, Jim."
KIRK,"If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway. There's no"
CHARLIE,I can make you all go away anytime I want to.
KIRK,"Get out of my chair, Charlie, and get out of it now."
CHARLIE,"I've got your ship, Captain."
KIRK,"Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more. I"
CHARLIE,"I could've sent you away before, but I didn't."
KIRK,You're going to have to take me on.
CHARLIE,Don't make me do it now.
KIRK,"You've got my ship, and I want it back. I want my crew back,"
CHARLIE,Don't push me.  Sorry. I'm sorry but. Stop
SPOCK,"Captain, the navigation console is clear now. The ship is"
UHURA,"Sir, something off our starboard bow. The message says they're"
CHARLIE,Oh.
RAND,"Captain, how did I?"
KIRK,"It's all right, Yeoman."
SPOCK,"Sensors show there something's there, Captain. Deflectors"

KIRK,We should have intercepted by now. The Bridge said they'd call.
SPOCK,I'll have you checkmated your next move.
KIRK,"Have I ever mentioned you play a very irritating game of chess,"
SPOCK,"Irritating? Ah, yes. One of your Earth emotions."
KIRK,Certain you don't know what irritation is?
SPOCK,The fact one of my ancestors married a human female

DEHNER,Women professionals do tend to overcompensate. Now let's talk
MITCHELL,"You know, everybody, everybody seems worried that I don't"
DEHNER,How did you do that?

DEHNER,"He can control certain autonomic reflexes. He reads very fast,"
KIRK,"Mister Scott, would you repeat what you just told us?"
SCOTT,"About an hour ago, the Bridge controls started going crazy."
SPOCK,And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time
KIRK,"Are they right, Doctor? Has he shown abilities of such magnitude?"
DEHNER,I saw some such indications.
KIRK,And you didn't think it worth mentioning?
DEHNER,"No one's been hurt, have they? Don't you understand? A mutated"

MITCHELL,Probably just what Mister Spock is thinking now. Kill me

MITCHELL,"I also know we're orbiting Delta Vega, Jim. I can't let you"

KIRK,Take him.
DEHNER,There's not a soul on this planet but us?
KIRK,"Nobody but us chickens, Doctor."
ALDEN,"I think I've got the 203-R set, Lee."
KELSO,"Good, Alden. Transport it up with you, will you?"
ALDEN,Okay.
KIRK,"The fuel bins, Lee. Could they be detonated from here?"
KELSO,A destruct switch? I guess I could wire one up right there.
KIRK,Do it.
SPOCK,He's regaining consciousness.
KIRK,Doctor Piper. I want only one medical officer
DEHNER,"I'd like to stay now, try to talk to him."
MITCHELL,My friend James Kirk. remember those rodent things on

RAND,"Mister Spock, I'm trying to get to the Bridge and this crewman"
SPOCK,"Crewman, stand aside."
MOODY,"Oh, yes, sir. I'll take you home again, Janice"
RAND,Spock!
SPOCK,Message from the captain.
SCOTT,Tell him I'm doing my best. If I cut through the wrong circuits
SPOCK,We have fourteen minutes left.
SCOTT,Even if we were under a full-scale attack I couldn't move any
SPOCK,"At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll"
MCCOY,"Biopsy lab. Biopsy, where's my report?"
CHAPEL,Sir?
MCCOY,Yes?
CHAPEL,The tranquillizer's wearing off.
MCCOY,"Oh, good. I'll need him conscious now. Continue to examine him"
CHAPEL,"Of course, Doctor."
KIRK,Get him out of here.
RAND,"I would have gotten here sooner, sir but Crewman Moody stopped me"
KIRK,Take the helm.
RAND,Sir?
KIRK,Take the helm!
RAND,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,At least try cutting him off!
UHURA,"Sir, if I could cut him off, don't you think I"
ll take you home again Kathleen UHURA,"Yes, sir. I'll keep trying."
KIRK,Sorry.
Across the ocean wild and wide KIRK,Scotty.
KIRK,We've got twelve minutes left. It'll take at least two or three
KIRK,Call me when you've cut through. I want to be there. Kirk out.
SPOCK,Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy?
CHAPEL,He's gone to the lab.
SPOCK,"Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab!"
CHAPEL,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,"What is it, Nurse?"
CHAPEL,"Mister Spock,  the men from Vulcan treat their"
SPOCK,"Nurse, you should"
CHAPEL,"Christine, please. I see things, how honest you are. I know how"
SPOCK,I'm in control of my emotions.
CHAPEL,"The others believe that. I don't. I love you. I don't know why,"
SPOCK,I'm sorry.
SPOCK,I am sorry.
CHAPEL,Christine.
SPOCK,Christine.
I will take you home Kathleen SCOTT,"Almost ready, sir."
ll take you to your homeSCOTT,"- Ready, sir."
KIRK, Follow me through. Put your phasers on stun. Don't
RILEY,I'll take. No dance tonight.
KIRK,Get him out of here.
SPOCK, I'm in control of my
KIRK,"Scotty, we haven't got much time left."
KIRK,Kirk here.
SCOTT,Captain.
KIRK,What is it?
SCOTT,He's turned the engines off. Completely cold. It will take
KIRK,Scotty!
SCOTT,I can't change the laws of physics. I've got to have thirty
SCOTT,"Maybe twenty two, twenty three minutes."
KIRK,"Scotty, we've got six."
SCOTT,"Captain, you can't mix matter and antimatter cold. We'd go up in"
the biggest explosion sinceKIRK,We can balance our engines into a controlled implosion.
SCOTT,That's only a theory. It's never been done.
KIRK,"Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet?"
SCOTT,"If you wanted to chance odds of ten thousand to one, maybe,"
UHURA,"Mister Spock is not on the Bridge, Captain."
SULU, I was on the Bridge.
MCCOY,McCoy to Bio. We've isolated it. Start preparing serum.
MCCOY,"It's water. Somehow on this planet, water's changed to a complex"
MCCOY,That's how we missed it. It passed from man to man through
SULU,"Doc, will you let me out of here? I'm all right."
MCCOY,Release him.
KIRK,Where have you been? What happened?
SPOCK,My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.
KIRK,"We've got four minutes, maybe five."
SPOCK,"An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad"
KIRK,We've got to risk a full-power start. The engines were shut off.
SPOCK,"I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth"
KIRK, You've got to hear me! We need a
SPOCK,"t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole"
KIRK,We've got to risk implosion. It's our only chance.
SPOCK,It's never been done.
KIRK,"Don't tell me that again, Science Officer! It's a theory. It's"
did you findKIRK,"Yes, I found Mister Spock! I'm talking to Mister Spock, do you"
UHURA,"Yes, sir. Three and a half minutes left, Captain."
KIRK,"I've got it, the disease. Love. You're better off without it, and"
SPOCK,Jim.
KIRK,"I have a beautiful yeoman. Have you noticed her, Mister Spock?"
s not permittedSPOCK,"Jim, there is an intermix formula."
KIRK,Now I know why it's called she.
SPOCK,It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between
KIRK,"Flesh woman to touch, to hold. A beach to walk on. A few days, no"
SCOTT,Captain.
KIRK,"Scotty, help."
SPOCK,Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.
KIRK,"I've got to hang on. Tell them. Clear the corridors, the turbo"
KIRK,Bridge.
KIRK,Engine room. We're set. Hyperbolic course.
BRENT,"Direction, sir?"
KIRK,Direction. Direction. It doesn't matter. The way we came.
SULU,"Course laid in, sir."
SPOCK,Fuel temperature.
SCOTT,Level.
KIRK, No beach to walk on.
RAND,Sir?
SPOCK,Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees.
SCOTT,That'll take four minutes.
SPOCK,"We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready."
KIRK,Engage.
SPOCK,"Are you all right, Jim?"
KIRK,Are you? 
MCCOY,We found a cure. We're over that part of it.
SPOCK,"Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded."
SULU,"Captain, my velocity gauge is off the scale."
SPOCK,Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling
KIRK,"Checked elapsed time, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"My chronometer's running backwards, sir."
KIRK,"Time warp. We're going backward in time. Helm, begin reversing"
SULU,"Helm answering, sir. Power reversing."
SPOCK,"We're back to normal time, Captain."
KIRK,Engines ahead. Warp one.
SULU,"Warp one, sir."
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,The time warp. What did it do to us?
SPOCK,We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days
KIRK,Not those last three days.
SPOCK,"This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the"
KIRK,"We may risk it someday, Mister Spock. Resume course to our next"
SULU,"Course laid in, sir."
KIRK,Steady as she goes.
Original Airdate,"6 Oct, 1966"
KIRK,That should make a good specimen.
SULU, Temperature's starting to drop.
KIRK,Yeah. At night it gets down to a hundred and twenty degrees below
SULU,That's nippy.
FISHER,Hey!
KIRK,What happened?
FISHER,"I fell off that bank, sir. Cut my hand."
KIRK,Let's see it. Get back to the ship. Report to the Sickbay.
FISHER,"Yes, sir. Geological Technician Fisher. Ready to beam up."
SCOTT,Right. Locked onto you. Energise. Coadjutor
WILSON,What happened?
FISHER,I took a flop.
WILSON,Onto what?
FISHER,I don't know. Some kind of yellow ore.
SCOTT,Magnetic. Decontaminate that uniform.
FISHER,"Yes, sir. "
SCOTT,That acted like a burnout.
SCOTT,"Just one moment, Captain. It checks out okay now. You better go"
WILSON,Yes sir.
SCOTT,"All right, Captain. Locked onto you. (Kirk stumbles as he leaves"
KIRK,"Yes, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy."
SCOTT,Let me give you a hand.
KIRK,I can't get through there. Nothing serious. Don't leave the
SCOTT,"Wilson will be right back, sir."
WILSON,"Captain? Are you all right, sir? Can I give"
KIRK,Thank you.
SCOTT,It might profit you to let Doctor McCoy give you the once-over.
KIRK,"All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to."
RAND,"Ship's manifests, sir. I think they're in"
KIRK,"Thank you, Yeoman."
RAND,I've checked
KIRK,That's all.
RAND,"Yes, sir. "
MCCOY,"You picked a good day, Fisher. Business has"
KIRK,Saurian brandy.
FISHER,"No, sir. The hand's much better, sir. "
MCCOY,"What can I do for you, Jim?"
KIRK," I said, give me the brandy! (leaves"
KIRK,Yeah.
KIRK,"Come in. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?"
SPOCK,"Is there something I can do for you, Captain?"
KIRK,Like what?
SPOCK,"Well, Doctor McCoy seemed to think I should check on you."
KIRK,"That's nice. Come on, Spock, I know that look. What is it?"
SPOCK,"Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man,"
KIRK,Our good doctor's been putting you on again.
SPOCK,"Hmm. Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain,"
KIRK,I'll tell him you were properly annoyed.
SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,"What is it, Scotty?"
SCOTT,Transporter breakdown. Continue circuit testing. We beamed up
KIRK,Yes?
SCOTT,A few seconds after they sent this one up through the
KIRK,"Oh, my."
RAND,"Oh! Captain, you startled me. Is there"
KIRK,"Jim will do here, Janice."
RAND,Oh.
KIRK,You're too beautiful to ignore. Too much woman. We've both been
RAND,Captain!
KIRK,"Just a minute, Janice. Just a minute! (forces her onto the floor,"
RAND,Call Mister Spock! Call Mister Spock!
FISHER,"Geological Technician Fisher. Deck twelve,"
KIRK,Me? My yeoman said that? I've been resting
SPOCK,Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay
KIRK,Not true. I haven't been to the Sickbay. Let's find out what's
KIRK,Sickbay. (just missing the other Kirk nursing
RAND,"Then he kissed me and he said that we, that"
KIRK,Us?
RAND,"Well, he is the captain. I couldn't just. You started hurting me."
KIRK,"Yeoman, look at me. Look at me, look at my face. Are there any"
RAND,I was sure I scratched you. I was frightened. Maybe
KIRK,Yeoman. I was in my room. It wasn't me.
RAND,"Sir, Fisher saw you, too."
KIRK,Fisher saw?
RAND,If it hadn't been. I can understand. I don't want to get you into
KIRK,It wasn't me!
FISHER,"It was you, sir."
KIRK,Do you know what you're saying?
FISHER,"Yes, I know what I'm saying."
MCCOY,"Back to that bed, bucko. Come on, let's go."
SPOCK,"You can go now, Yeoman.  There's only one logical"
KIRK,How did all this happen?
SCOTT,"I don't know sir, but when Fisher came up, his suit was covered"
KIRK,Does the transporter work at all?
SCOTT,"Yes sir, but we don't dare bring up the landing party. It might"
KIRK,How long will it take you to find the trouble?
SCOTT,"Can't say, sir."
KIRK,We just can't leave those four men down there. It's getting dark.
SCOTT,"We're doing everything we can, sir."
KIRK,"Yes, I know, Scotty."
SPOCK,"About your double, Captain."
KIRK,"Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him. Search parties, Mister"
SPOCK,We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous
KIRK,"Yes, that's right. We don't know, but the men have to be armed."
SPOCK,"How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are"
KIRK,Tell them.
SPOCK,"The search parties, Captain."
KIRK,"Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what"
SPOCK,"Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you"
KIRK,"Yes, I do know that, Mister Spock. What I don't know is why I"
SPOCK,"Understood, Captain."
KIRK,"Section chiefs, assign personnel to the"
KIRK,Something?
SPOCK,About the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and
KIRK,"Oh, yes, yes. All hand phasers must be set on base cycle,"
the imposter KIRK,I'm Captain Kirk!
KIRK,I'm Captain Kirk. I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain
WILSON,Sir?
KIRK,"Wilson, give me your phaser."
WILSON,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,How have you been?
WILSON,"Fine, sir. "
SULU,It's already twenty degrees below zero. Can't exactly
KIRK,Isn't there any way we can help them?
SPOCK,Thermal heaters were transported down. They duplicated. They
KIRK,Then we've got to get those men up.
SPOCK,Spock here.
SPOCK,Acknowledged. Continue the search.
KIRK,"We've got to find him before he, but how?"
SPOCK,"Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has"
KIRK,The lower levels. The Engineering deck.
SPOCK,"Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to"
KIRK,No. I don't want anyone else to see the
SPOCK,"Captain, you ordered me to tell you."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, if I'm to be the Captain, I've got to act like one."
KIRK,You can't hurt me. You can't kill me. You can't. Don't you
OTHER KIRK,"I don't need you. (Spock neck-pinches him, and his phaser"
MCCOY,"He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and"
KIRK,"Yes. yes, all right. What's the matter with me?"
SPOCK,"Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the"
MCCOY,"You have a point, Spock?"
SPOCK,"Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to"
MCCOY,"It's the Captain's guts you're analysing. Are you of that,"
SPOCK,"Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We"
KIRK,"What is your point, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be"
MCCOY,"You have your intellect, Jim. You can fight with that!"
KIRK,For how long?
SPOCK,"If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain,"
KIRK,Kirk here.
SCOTT,I've found a new trouble with the
SULU,"Can you give us a status report, Captain?"
SULU,Do you think you might be able to find a long rope somewhere and
KIRK,I'll see what we can do.
KIRK,"Engineering deck, Kirk here."
KIRK,"That unit, Scotty, status report."
KIRK,How bad is it?
SULU, I think we ought
KIRK,"Kirk here, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,I gave everybody the afternoon off. I'm watching the store.
SULU,"Oh, lovely, except that the frost is building up. We're using"
SPOCK,"This is Spock, Mister Sulu. You'll have to"
KIRK,What happened?
MCCOY,Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication
KIRK,He's not dying?
KIRK,"Yes, he is."
OTHER KIRK,Help me.
KIRK,How can he die? Can I survive without him?
MCCOY,"I don't know, Jim."
KIRK,Don't be afraid. Here's my hand. Hold on. You don't have to be
MCCOY,"Jim, he is back! Jim, you can use that brandy now. In fact, I'll"
KIRK,I have to take him back inside myself. I can't survive without
MCCOY,"Jim, you're no different than anyone else. We all have our"
KIRK,Human.
MCCOY,"Yes, human. A lot of what he is makes you the man you are. God"
KIRK,What do I have?
MCCOY,You have the goodness.
KIRK,Not enough. I have a ship to command.
MCCOY,"The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of"
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,Coming.
KIRK,What is it?
SCOTT,"We've found a way to get the transporter working, sir."
SPOCK,We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for
KIRK,"Yes, yes. Go ahead."
SCOTT, I'll grab him by the
KIRK,Don't hurt him.
SPOCK,It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only
SCOTT,"If this doesn't work, I don't know what will."
SPOCK,Energise. Reverse.
SPOCK,The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too
MCCOY,"He's dead, Jim."
MCCOY,Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know.
SPOCK,"For once, I agree with you."
MCCOY,"I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a"
SPOCK,"No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified,"
KIRK,"Yes, yes, that sounds likely."
SPOCK,It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence
KIRK,Get the transporter room ready.
MCCOY,"Could be, if, maybe. All guesswork so far. Just theory. Jim, why"
KIRK,"That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check"
SPOCK,"Aren't you forgetting something, Captain?"
KIRK,"No, I don't think I've for"
SPOCK,Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left?
KIRK,"Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones."
Their lives MCCOY,"Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim. Suppose death was caused by"
SPOCK,"Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a"
KIRK,Help me. Somebody make the decision.
SPOCK,"Are you relinquishing your command, Captain?"
KIRK,"No. No, I'm not."
MCCOY,"Well then, we can't help you, Jim. The decision is yours."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, ready the transporter room. Bones, continue the"
KIRK,Kirk here.
SULU,"Captain K-Kirk, Sulu here. One hundred"
KIRK,Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu. Can't wait. Can't let them die.
OTHER KIRK,What are you going to do?
KIRK,"Go through the transporter, both of us."
OTHER KIRK,There's nothing I can do to stop you.
KIRK,It's what I have to do. It's what I have to do. What we have to
OTHER KIRK,"I won't fight you anymore. Oh, I feel so weak. I'll be glad"
KIRK,"Janice, hello."
RAND,"Captain, I"
KIRK,"Yeoman, I owe you an explanation."
RAND,No.
KIRK,"Yes, I do. The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a"
RAND,"No, sir."
KIRK, Bridge.
FARRELL,"No word from Mister Sulu, sir."
OTHER KIRK,"Prepare to leave orbit, Mister Farrell. Well?"
FARRELL,Captain!
OTHER KIRK,"I gave you an order, Mister Farrell."
FARRELL,But what about
OTHER KIRK,They can't be saved. Prepare to leave orbit.
FARRELL,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,"Captain, I thought the plan"
OTHER KIRK,"I've changed my mind. Man your station, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,No!
OTHER KIRK,"McCoy, he's fooled you."
MCCOY,He  attacked him.
OTHER KIRK,"Mister Spock, you know who I am. You know what that is."
FARRELL,"Mister Spock, which one? What do we do?"
SPOCK,We'll let the captain handle this.
OTHER KIRK,I'm the captain. Isn't that obvious? Look at his face.
KIRK,"Yes, I know."
OTHER KIRK,"You want to kill me, don't you? Farrell, James, grab him."
KIRK,Can half a man live?
OTHER KIRK,"Take another step, you'll die."
KIRK,Then we'll both die.
OTHER KIRK,"Please, I don't want to. Don't make me. Don't make me."
KIRK,You will. Both of us.
OTHER KIRK,I want to live!
SPOCK,"You'll have to hold on to him, Captain."
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,Captain?
KIRK,If this doesn't work.
SPOCK,"Understood, Captain."
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,Ready. 
MCCOY,"Well, Mister Spock?  Jim?"
KIRK,Get those men aboard fast.
SPOCK,"Right away, Captain."
MCCOY," Severe exposure and frostbite,"
KIRK,How? I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.
FARRELL,"Status report, green."
SPOCK,"All sections report ready, sir."
KIRK,"Good. Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us."
SPOCK,"Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir?"
KIRK,The impostor's back where he belongs. Let's forget him.
RAND,"Captain? The impostor told me what happened, who he really was,"
d like is KIRK,"Thank you, Yeoman."
SPOCK,"The, er, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you"
KIRK,"This is the Captain speaking. Navigator, set in course"
Original Airdate,"13 Oct, 1966"
SULU,"There he is, sir. Centre screen. Still trying"
KIRK,"Don't lose him, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"No, sir."
KIRK,"Earth ship, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Difficult to say, Captain. We're getting no registration beam"
SCOTT,"If it is, he'll soon overload his engines."
SPOCK,"Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard."
SULU,Changing course again. He knows we're after him all right.
KIRK,"Stay with him, Mister Sulu. Communication?"
UHURA,"I've tried all frequencies, sir. He refuses to answer. Unless"
KIRK,He's receiving us alright.
SPOCK,"Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain. Schiller rating three"
KIRK,"Deflectors on, Mister Farrell."
SULU,"He's seen the asteroids too, sir."
KIRK,Stay with him. He'll try to lose us in them.
SULU,If one hits him.
SPOCK,Sensor reading on the vessel. I make it out as a small class J
KIRK,Try to warn him. If he loses power now
FARRELL,"There go his engines, sir."
SULU,"He's drifting into the asteroid belt, Captain."
FARRELL,"He's had it, unless we put our deflector screen around him."
SCOTT,"Captain, if we try, we'll overload our own engines. He's too far"
KIRK,"Cover him with our deflector screen, Mister Farrell. Scotty,"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. "
FARRELL,"We're protecting him, sir. We won't be able to hold it long."
SULU,"We're overloading, Captain. Engine temperatures climbing."
SULU,"That was one of our lithium crystal circuits, sir."
KIRK,Bridge to transporter room. If you don't start beaming that crew
UHURA,"I'm getting a distress signal call from them, sir."
KIRK,"Scotty, we're getting a distress signal."
SCOTT,"We're locked onto something, Captain."
MUDD,"Meaning no ingratitude, gentlemen, but just where is it I find"
MCCOY,You're aboard the U. S. S. Enterprise.
MUDD,"It's really a darn beautiful ship, isn't it? Really a beautiful"
SPOCK,How many more in your crew?
MUDD,Just a few more.
SCOTT,"Your vessel's breaking up, man. If we don't get them over here"
right now MUDD,"We couldn't be sure you was a friendly vessel, now could we. Ah,"
SULU,Another lithium circuit. Now supplementing
KIRK,"Scotty, how many of them did you get aboard?"
SPOCK,What's wrong?
SCOTT,"I don't know, sir. With those three lithium crystals gone"
SPOCK,It'll take longer on battery power.
MCCOY,Never trusted this.
FARRELL,There she goes.
SULU,Asteroid hit him dead centre.
SCOTT,"Not yet, sir, but we've hooked onto something. (three women beam"
MUDD,"It's all right, darlings. We're in good hands."
KIRK,Bridge to transporter room.
FARRELL,"We're clearing the asteroid belt now, Captain."
KIRK,"Deflector screen down, Mister Farrell. Save the power."
SCOTT,"Oh, er, four in all, sir."
KIRK,I want him there whether he can walk or not.
MUDD,"That fellow sounded a mite upset, didn't he?"
MCCOY,"Yes. Yes, they are."
SPOCK,"Curious. You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh?"
MUDD,"Oh, no, that's everyone, all right, but so far as the ladies"
actually being the crew SPOCK,You can explain that to the Captain. 
MCCOY,"Amen to that, Scotty."
MUDD,"Ah, sure, these starships are really"
SPOCK,Deck twelve.
MUDD,"You're part Vulcanian, aren't you. Ah well then, a pretty face"
EVE,"I apologise for what he said, sir. He's used to buying and selling"
MUDD,"I'll handle the conversation, darling."
KIRK,Come.
SPOCK,"The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain."
KIRK,"Good. Now, if you don't mind telling"
EVE,Hello.
KIRK,"And the ladies? Is this your crew, Captain?"
MUDD,"Well, no, Captain. This is me cargo."
MUDD,"Well, how the devil am I supposed to know"
KIRK,"Your name, please."
MUDD,"Walsh. Leo Walsh. You destroyed me ship, Captain."
KIRK,"Mister Walsh, I'm convening a ship's hearing on your actions."
MUDD,"You're a hard-nosed one, Captain."
KIRK,"And you're a liar, Mister Walsh. I think we both understand each"
SULU,"You're on duty, Johnny-o. Back to reality."
FARRELL,"You can feel their eyes when they look at you, like something"
SULU,"I noticed. How I noticed. Come on, Johnny."
SCOTT,"We've got trouble, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,"One lithium crystal left, and that with a hairline split at the"
SPOCK,Better rig a by-pass circuit.
SCOTT,Can't. We blew the whole converter assembly.
SPOCK,"Needed on the bridge, Captain."
WOMEN,Harry! Where were you?
MUDD,"Shh! Calm down now, darlings. Would you mind waiting outside?"
SECURITY,"Sorry, sir."
MUDD,"Well, now, answer every question they put to you. Don't lie."
RUTH,What if they ask about
MUDD,They won't. Have you no place to go lads?
MAGDA,They'll notice we're different.
MUDD,"No, no, no, they won't. Just let Leo take all the hard questions."
ll get to EVE,"Get where? We don't have a ship and we're headed the wrong way,"
NUDD,"Leo. Leo Walsh is me name, darling. Don't forget that. So lovely."
SPOCK,The entire ship's power is feeding through
KIRK,"Well, switch to by-pass circuits."
SCOTT,We burned them all out when we super-heated. That jackass Walsh
but in saving his skin KIRK,"If it makes you feel better, Engineer, that's one jackass we're"
SCOTT,But it's frustrating. Almost a million gross tons of vessel
SPOCK,"And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power"
KIRK,"Well, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel 12. High-grade ore,"
KIRK,Location and distance.
SPOCK,Mister Farrell has the course. Less than two day's travel.
KIRK,"Make for Rigel 12, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Rigel 12, Mister Farrell. You have the course."

MUDD,What? My tiny ship in this immense galaxy a menace to navigation?
KIRK,You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's

MUDD,"All right. Well, very simply, Leo Walsh, who was to be my captain"
KIRK,Destination and purpose of journey?
MUDD,Planet Ophiuchus 3. Wiving settlers.
KIRK,"Come again, Mister Mudd. You do what?"
MUDD,"I recruit wives for settlers, a difficult but satisfying task."
KIRK,Data on witnesses.
COMPUTER,No data.
KIRK,"Computer, go to sensor probe. Any unusual readings?"

MUDD,"Oh, you beautiful galaxy! Oh, that heavenly universe! Well,"
RUTH,May I come in?
MCCOY,"Why, yes, please do. By all means. Connors, are you finished?"
RUTH,I was wondering what this place looked like. It's fascinating.
MCCOY,"Would, Would you walk past my panel again, please?"
RUTH,Your what?
MCCOY,My medical scanner.
RUTH,"Oh, why? You're not giving me an examination, are you?"
MCCOY,"Oh no. I wouldn't trust my, my judgment, believe me. Just walk"
RUTH,"I wondered, will you be examining the miners on Rigel 12?"
MCCOY,"Yes, if they need it."
RUTH,You haven't asked yet? Are they in good health and all?
MCCOY,"What? Oh, yes, they're in excellent health, all three of them."
RUTH,Oh. Three.
MCCOY,Are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something
RUTH,No. I'm just me.
MCCOY,I wonder what makes it do that.
EVE,Captain? I hope you don't mind.
KIRK,"As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do."
EVE,"I was trying to take a walk, and I just, I just had to run in"
KIRK,"Yes. I'll have to talk to them about that. They, er, they don't"
er EVE,They're probably just lonely. I can understand loneliness.
KIRK,"Yes. Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron"

KIRK,"Miss McHuron, I don't"
EVE,"Oh, no! Oh, I just can't do it. I don't care what Harry Mudd says."
MUDD,Just three? You're sure?
RUTH,Yes. The miners are healthy and fairly young.
MUDD,"Later, dear, later. Magda, did you get to your communications"
MAGDA,The head miner is named Ben Childress. The others are Gossett

RUTH,And you must be Herm Gossett.
GOSSETT,"Yes, I reckon I am."

KIRK,It's still no deal.

GOSSETT,I'm cutting in.
BENTON,Not on me. 
CHILDRESS,What's the matter with you?
EVE,Why don't you run a raffle and the loser gets me? 
CHILDRESS,You can't go out there. You'll get killed.
KIRK,Just have those crystals here when I get back.
KIRK,Eve! Eve!
FARRELL,Traverse parallel three and four.
SULU,"Checking, but not getting much."
SPOCK,"The storm is ionising the atmosphere, Captain. Getting difficult"
SCOTT,"Captain, this is draining our batteries further. If we only had"
KIRK,But we don't! I didn't get any. I should have found a way.
UHURA,"Losing communications with the miners, sir. Magnetic storm seems"
KIRK,Has Childress reported in yet?
UHURA,"No, sir. He and the girl are still missing."
KIRK,"Sorry, Scotty. How much power do we have left?"
SCOTT,"About five hours, sir."
SPOCK,"Infrared reading. Check traverse three, grid"
FARRELL,"About eleven miles, bearing one two one from the mining"
SULU,That's Ben Childress' quarters.
SPOCK,There's a heat unit operating in there. It could be a cookstove.
KIRK,Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room.
SPOCK,Mudd?
KIRK,The name of this game.
CHILDRESS,I had things where I wanted them.
EVE,"I ate some of your food, so I paid with some chores."
CHILDRESS,And I do my own cooking. I've not laid a hand on you.
EVE,"Oh, the sound of male ego. You travel halfway across the galaxy,"
CHILDRESS,"I guess I'm supposed to sit, taste, and roll my eyes. Ooh,"
EVE,Well you're tasting some of it now. I couldn't scrape three layers
CHILDRESS,"You find me a well, some decent water, then talk."
EVE,"Well, why don't you hang your pan out in the wind and let the sand"
CHILDRESS, It might work. That solitaire?
EVE,Double jack.
CHILDRESS,The red eight ought to go on the black nine.
EVE,Not in double jack.

CHILDRESS,She's been bubbling with gratitude ever since.

MUDD,"Ah. Yes, well."
KIRK,"The Venus drugs, Harry."
CHILDRESS,"Venus drug? I've heard of it but, it's not just one of those"
KIRK,"Oh, it exists, illegally."
MUDD,"Well, actually, you see, it's a relatively harmless drug."
EVE,Harmless!
MUDD,"Well, what it does is give you more of whatever you have. Well,"
and KIRK,He gave it to the women before you met them.
CHILDRESS,Does that mean the others? They really look like she does?
MUDD,"Mister Childress, I"
CHILDRESS,Is that what it means?
EVE,"Yes, that's what it means!"
CHILDRESS,What happened to my partners?
KIRK,"They've left for their quarters during the storm, Childress."

CHILDRESS,"A fake, pumped up by a drug."
KIRK,By herself. She took no drug.
EVE,I swallowed it.
KIRK,Coloured gelatin.
MUDD,"Yes, they took away my drug and substituted that."
EVE,But that can't be.
KIRK,There's only one kind of woman.
MUDD,"Or man, for that matter."
KIRK,"You either believe in yourself, or you don't. All right"
KIRK,Stand by. Do I beam down a search party?
CHILDRESS,"No, the crystals are here, and you're welcome to them."
KIRK,"Stand by, Mister Spock. We're coming aboard with the lithium"
CHILDRESS,"Eve will stay, today at least. We, er, we want to talk."
KIRK,Eve?
EVE,You've got someone up there called the Enterprise.
KIRK,"Two of us, Mister Spock. Come on, Mister Mudd."
MUDD,"Don't you think you could possibly, by accident, arrange to leave"
KIRK,"I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness"
MUDD,They'll throw away the key.
MCCOY,That must have been quite a talk you made
KIRK,Why should I work your side of the street?

KIRK,"Agreed, Doctor. However, there will be two of us."
CHAPEL,"Hello, Roger."
CHAPEL,"Yes, Roger."
CHAPEL,"Yes, Roger. Everything's all right now."
KIRK,"We're on our way, Doctor. We'll be with you in a moment."

MATTHEWS,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Is that you, Doctor Korby?"
CHAPEL,"Doctor Brown! It's Roger's assistant. Brownie, where's Roger?"
BROWN,Be careful.
KIRK,Is there a path down there?
BROWN,"There's no hope, Captain. It's bottomless. He must have slipped."
KIRK,Any chance of a projection or a ledge?
BROWN,"None, Captain. Unfortunate. Terribly unfortunate. Doctor Korby"
KIRK,Not soon enough.
CHAPEL,"Brownie, what is it?"
BROWN,Explain.
CHAPEL,Don't you recognise me?
BROWN,"Christine. You look well. My name is Brown, Doctor Korby's"
KIRK,You do know him well? An old friend?

KIRK,"There's no need to apologise, sir, and certainly no need to"
BROWN,"The captain lost a man in the caverns, Doctor."
KORBY,What? How did it happen?
BROWN,The pit near the outer junction. The edge must have given way.
KORBY,"I'm terribly sorry, Captain. Perhaps if I'd been there. I know"
KIRK,"It wasn't your fault. Kirk to Rayburn, report. I'm required to"
any special needs KORBY,"Captain, I'd much prefer"

KIRK,And Korby?

MIRI,"You are. They will, when Onlies get old."
RAND,Grownups.
KIRK,"You said something about the Grups doing bad things, yelling,"
MIRI,That was when they started to get sick in the before time. We
KIRK,You're doing fine.
MCCOY,You said the Grups got sick. Is that why there aren't any of
MIRI,"Yes. They died, but that was after the awful things."
MCCOY,"A plague, Captain. That could explain a lot of it."
KIRK,"But what about the children, the Onlies? Didn't the awful things"
MIRI,"Of course not. We're here, aren't we?"
KIRK,More of you? How many?
MIRI,All there are.
KIRK,What's your name?
MIRI,Miri.
KIRK,Miri. A pretty name for a pretty young woman.
MIRI,Pretty?
KIRK,Very pretty.
SPOCK,Guards! Cover me.
SPOCK,"Children, Captain. Lots of them. We couldn't"
KIRK,Miri said all the adults died.
MCCOY,That creature which attacked us was certainly no child. Perhaps
KIRK,There must be records somewhere and answers to some of our
MIRI,"Yes, I know that. Them and their pills and things."
KIRK,Will you take me there?
MIRI,That's a bad place.
KIRK,It's important. Please.
MIRI,"All right. Do you have a name, too?"
KIRK,Yes. It's Jim.
MIRI,I like that name.
KIRK,"Good. I like yours, too. I like you."
MIRI,Do you really?
KIRK,I wouldn't lie to you.
MIRI,"I wouldn't lie to you, either, Jim. I remember the Grups, but"
KIRK,"Why, thank you. "
MIRI,It's already starting. I knew it would. Just like it did with the
MCCOY,A veritable zoo of bacteria. Beam down a

KIRK, Intermediate experimentation report project on life
SPOCK,"Progress report, genetics section, Life Prolongation Project."
RAND,So that's what it was.
MCCOY,"Life prolongation. Didn't have much luck, did they?"
MCCOY,Tubular with extreme multiplicability.
SPOCK,"This was three hundred years ago, Captain."
KIRK,All the adults are dead. Only the children are left alive.
SPOCK,But children become adults.
KIRK,At least they have up to now.
SPOCK,"Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place"
MCCOY,Of course. It changes the entire body system. You know that. Of
SPOCK,"Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter"
KIRK,That would explain why there are no adults.
MCCOY,"Glandular, post-pubescent. Could be."
SPOCK,It's illogical. It does not follow. All the adults on this

MCCOY,But how do they keep the line going?

SPOCK,"There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain."
MCCOY,"She likes you, Jim."
SPOCK,She's becoming a woman.
FARRELL,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,Spock here.
SPOCK,"Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now."
KIRK, Try again. See if you can find anything outside.
MIRI,"All right, Jim."
KIRK,Thank you.
SPOCK,"According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought"
RAND,One hundred years and only one month?
SPOCK,"Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this"
RAND,But that means these children
SPOCK,Could very well be immensely old.
KIRK,That would certainly answer the question of what happened to
MCCOY,Answers it very well.
RAND,"Children who never age. Eternal childhood, filled with play, no"
KIRK,"I wouldn't examine that dream too closely, Yeoman. It might not"
MCCOY,A few days ago or a week ago that creature that attacked us
RAND,Do you suppose she knows?
KIRK,I don't think so.
RAND,"If they're as old as Spock claims, they must have some idea of"
KIRK,There's no adult interpretation. I think we're dealing with
SPOCK,"Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them."
KIRK,You couldn't get close to the other kids?
SPOCK,"Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice."
KIRK,I'm going to try. Miri? Come here. You want to go someplace with
MIRI,Sure. 
RAND,That little girl
SPOCK,"Is at least three hundred years older than you are, Yeoman."
JAHN,Miri is with them! Why? Why?

JAHN,"I don't, I don't know. I know what we've got to do. There are"
RED HEAD BOY,"I remember, Jahn, the way it was."
JAHN,"That's right, the way it was in the before time. They talk to the"
RED HEAD BOY,But they don't see us. We hide. Olly olly oxen free!
CHILDREN,Olly olly oxen free! Olly olly oxen free! Olly olly oxen
JAHN,"No! It's not a game, it's real. They're dangerous, they're Grups."
MASKED BOY,Jahn!
JAHN," All right, let's hide!"
KIRK,Dead. I don't understand it. My phaser wasn't set to kill.
MIRI,Her name was Louise. She was just a little bit older than I am
SPOCK,Acknowledged.
MIRI," Are these enough, Jim?"
KIRK,"We could use some more, if you don't mind."
MIRI,"No, I don't mind."
KIRK,There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here?
SPOCK,This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the
MCCOY,"Only a matter of time before we all go mad, destroy each other,"
KIRK,What about Miri?
SPOCK,Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter
MCCOY,What about us?
SPOCK,"The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the"
KIRK,And you? The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you.
SPOCK,"I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship,"
KIRK,"Of course, Mister Spock. We still don't know what we're fighting."
MCCOY,"No, but we know what it is and how fast it does it. It's"
KIRK,Are You certain about the time we have left?
SPOCK,I presume my calculations are correct.
KIRK,Is there any possibility
SPOCK,Spock here.
SPOCK,"Verified, Captain. We have seven days."
KIRK,"There's no data, no starting point."
MCCOY,I think I've found it.
KIRK,"Janice, take Miri for a walk."
RAND,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,Only one half intact.
KIRK,But do you know what they were up to?
MCCOY,"More or less. The idea was to create a new series of diseases, a"

KIRK,You two will have to recreate their thinking. If you can isolate

SPOCK,"Communicators, Captain, they're gone."

MIRI,It's easy. She's always asking me about the youngest little

JAHN,"But Grups, they know things and all that. You know, I bet they'll"
MIRI,"Not one, two. Because he'll try to find her."
RED HEAD BOY,"Who? Who will, Miri?"
MIRI,"The Captain. He'll try to find her, but he won't. Mister"

CHILDREN,Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk!
MCCOY,It looks right.
SPOCK,"The nitrogen cycle, it has to be."
MCCOY,"But the question is, what's the dosage?"
SPOCK,That is a very good question.
KIRK,"Where is she, Miri? Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice?"
MIRI,What's the matter with you? How should I know?
KIRK,Where is she? Has something happened to her?
MIRI,Don't you feel all right?
KIRK,"No, I don't feel all right! None of us feel all right! Can't you"
MIRI,"Jim, I don't want anything to happen to you."
KIRK,I've got to find Janice.
SPOCK,"That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators."
KIRK,"We're trying, Mister Spock. We're trying very hard."
MCCOY,"That's not good enough! This could be it, but we can't test it"
SPOCK,"We've got to have those communicators, Jim."
KIRK,This is the vaccine?
MCCOY,That's what the computers will tell us.
SPOCK,"Without them, it could be a beaker full of death."
KIRK,Did you hear them? We only have a few hours left.
MIRI,I don't care.
KIRK,"You've got to care. Miri, I'm going to tell you something. You,"
MIRI,Sometimes it happens.
KIRK,"Not sometimes. All the times, Miri! As soon as you start growing"
MIRI,That's not true. It just happens sometimes.
KIRK,"All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! Look at it."
MIRI,No! No! No!
RED HEAD BOY,"Blah, blah, blah!"
JAHN,"No, you got the wrong game. A teacher, I told you. Now, what does"
RED HEAD BOY,"Yeah. Study, study, study, or bonk bonk, bad kid."
RAND,It's not funny.
JAHN,It's a foolie.
RAND,What are you going to do with me?
JAHN,"You think I'd tell you? Miri, you're not supposed to be here."
MIRI,I know.
JAHN,"What's the matter, something go wrong?"
MIRI,No.
JAHN,"Okay, then. Don't just stand there in the doorway, come on in."
MIRI,Listen to him.
JAHN,"You listen, Miri."
MIRI,"I did. Why do you think I brought him here? Tell them, Jim."
JAHN,"Tell'em, Jim. Tell'em, Jim."
CHILDREN,"Tell'em, Jim! Tell'em, Jim! Tell'em, Jim! Tell'em, Jim!"
KIRK,Listen to me. Listen to me!
JAHN,"No yelling in the classroom! Look at him, a very bad citizen."
KIRK,This isn't a game. It never was a game.
BLONDE GIRL,Call the police!
RED HEAD BOY,I'm the police. Bonk bonk unless you're good.
JAHN,You're the teacher.
RED HEAD BOY,I got two jobs. Bonk bonk!
CHILDREN,Blah blah blah! Blah blah blah! Blah blah blah! Blah blah

KIRK,"All right, you want a foolie? All right. I dare you, I"
MCCOY,We can't wait for those communicators any
SPOCK,We must. The vaccine could be fatal.
MCCOY,"The disease certainly is. How long do we have left? Hours,"
SPOCK,Bickering is pointless. I'll check on the Captain's progress.
MCCOY,Spock!
GALLOWAY,"Is he dead, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,Not yet.
KIRK," Three hours, eleven minutes"
SPOCK,He injected himself with the vaccine. He was unconscious when I
KIRK,Look at his face.
SPOCK,The blemishes are fading. They're fading. Who will understand
JAHN,"Is this supposed to be a good thing, Miri?"
MIRI,Of course it is.
RAND,They were just children. Simply to leave them
there with a medical team KIRK,"Just children, three hundred years old and more. I've already"
MCCOY,"And truant officers, I presume."
KIRK,They'll be all right.
RAND,"Miri. She really loved you, you know."

SPOCK,"We disposed of emotion, Doctor. Where there is no emotion there"
GELDER,Where's the captain? Which one of you is the captain?
KIRK,I'm Captain Kirk.
GELDER,My name is Van Gelder. I want asylum.
KIRK,At gunpoint?
GELDER,"I want your promise first, your word that you won't take me"
KIRK,No promises. Give me the weapon.
GELDER,"No! No. No, I'm not going back! I'll disable your vessel first."
KIRK,Take him to Sickbay. Reverse course. Head back for Tantalus
MCCOY,"Abnormal, of course, but it's not"
KIRK,Your report said he was quite talkative.

KIRK,U. S. S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
KIRK,This is Captain Kirk. I'd like to speak to Doctor Adams.

NOEL,"Perhaps it would be simpler if you called me Helen, Captain,"
since KIRK,"This is another time, another place, and another situation."

KIRK,"Elevator, and going down quite a ways."
NOEL, I wouldn't recommend it for weak hearts.

KIRK,"Doctor Helen Noel. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, sir."
ADAMS,"Thank you. Thank you, Captain. Welcome to Devil's Island, Doctor."
NOEL,"Perhaps you'll call me Helen, Doctor. With so many titles around,"
ADAMS,I shall indeed. Won't you?
NOEL,Thank you.
KIRK,I believe regulations call for me to check my weapon.
ADAMS,"No, no. That won't be necessary in your case, Captain. Just keep"
KIRK,Doctor.
ADAMS,"Oh, now, Captain, you made your apology from upstairs. Now"
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
KIRK,"Your landing co-ordinates were right on the nose, Mister Spock."
ADAMS,"Ah, Lethe, come in. Lethe, this is Captain Kirk and Doctor Helen"
LETHE,I love my work.
ADAMS,"Go right ahead, Captain."
KIRK,Before you came here
LETHE,"I was another person, malignant, hateful."
KIRK,May I ask what crime you committed?
LETHE,Does it matter? That person no longer exists.
ADAMS,"Um, part of our cure, if you will, Captain, is to bury the past."
NOEL,A shifting of memory patterns is basic to psychotherapy.
ADAMS,"Yes. And now to the toast, hmm? You'll forgive us, Lethe. There"
KIRK,"Quite a tour, Doctor. Very impressive."
ADAMS,"Thank you. Hi, Carl."
KIRK,Doctor.
ADAMS,Yes?

KIRK,May I see it?
NOEL,"Captain, if something hasn't worked out and therefore has no"
scientific factKIRK,Shall we leave it up to the doctor?
NOEL,"Since you brought me down here for advice, Captain"

GELDER,

KIRK,"One question, Doctor. If it doesn't do any good"
ADAMS,"Why do we go on using it, hmm, Captain? Hope. Yes, yes, there's"
NOEL,"Tranquillisers are fine, Captain, but to continually pump"
s bloodstream ADAMS,"Exactly my point, Helen. Yes. Shall we? "
KIRK, How does it work?
THERAPIST,"Quite simple. Off on switches, and the large control here"
ADAMS,"Captain, you remind me of the ancient sceptic who demanded of"
NOEL,"Beam neutralising has been experimented with on Earth, Captain."
KIRK,"I didn't mean to suggest that he had. The reason I asked, sir,"
ADAMS,"Right here, Captain. Yes, Simon was a very stubborn man. He"
KIRK, Thank you. 
THERAPIST, You will forget all you have
SPOCK,"Can you give us your present location,"
SPOCK,Then you're with Doctor Adams now.
SPOCK,"Captain, Van Gelder has made reference to a particular treatment"
KIRK,Yes. He was injured there. I've seen the

SPOCK,"When do you plan to beam back up, Captain?"
KIRK,"I think we'll spend the night here, Mister Spock."

SPOCK,And you will continue to check in every four hours?
KIRK,Kirk out.
GELDER,"No! No. No, don't let them! You must warn"

GELDER,Right death.

NOEL,Good evening.
KIRK,What did you think of the inmates we saw here this afternoon?
NOEL,"You could've waited until tomorrow morning to ask me that,"
KIRK,I didn't.
NOEL,"I thought they were happy, well-adjusted."
KIRK,But a bit blank.
NOEL,"Captain, if you're questioning the methods of a man like Tristan"
AdamsKIRK,I'd like to see that treatment room again. You say you're

GELDER,We are Simon Van Gelder.

KIRK,Mm-hmm.
NOEL,"We'll try minimum intensity, a second or two. "
KIRK,"Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two."
NOEL,"We already tried it for that long, Captain."
KIRK,Nothing happened.
NOEL,Something happened. Your face went completely blank.
KIRK,Try a harmless suggestion.
NOEL, You're hungry.

KIRK,"You want me to manufacture a lie, wrap it up as a Christmas"
NOEL,"No, I prefer honesty. "

KIRK,I believe in you.
ADAMS,You trust me completely.
KIRK,I trust you.
ADAMS,"Excellent, Captain. I compliment you. Do you know Doctor Van"
LETHE,"The woman doctor. She's gone, Doctor Adams."
ADAMS,"Notify security at once, Lethe. Where is she, Captain?"
KIRK,"I, argh, I don't know."
ADAMS,Where is Helen And with what instructions?
KIRK,I don't know. 
SPOCK,Emergency channel D.
BERKELEY,"It's no good, Mister Spock. I can't break through their force"
SPOCK,Keep trying.
ADAMS,"Put him back in the chair, Eli, and find"
BERKELEY,"Mister Spock, the force field is gone. I"
SPOCK, Get some security people and follow me down.
SPOCK," Enterprise, this is Spock. Force"
NOEL,Captain. Captain?
KIRK," Helen, are you all right? "
NOEL,"Yes. This isn't right, Captain.  Doctor Adams did"
KIRK,Doctor Adams? Doctor A. The treatment room. Follow me.
MCCOY,Jim! 
KIRK,The power came on.
MCCOY,"He's dead, Captain."
NOEL,The machine wasn't on high enough to kill.
KIRK,But he was alone. Can you imagine the mind emptied by that thing?
NOEL,I understand.
UHURA,"Oh, Captain, there was a message from"
SPOCK,It was from Van Gelder. He thought you'd like to know the
KIRK,Thank you.
MCCOY,It's hard to believe that a man could die of loneliness.
KIRK,"Not when you've sat in that room. Take us out of orbit, Mister"
SPOCK,"Acknowledged, Captain. Warp factor one."
Original Airdate,"10 Nov, 1966"
SPOCK,One degree to overlap. Stand by to
BAILEY,"Three days of this now, sir. Other ships must have made star"
SPOCK,"Negative, Lieutenant. We are the first to reach this far."
SULU,"Sir, contact with an object. It's moving toward us. No visual"
SPOCK,"Deflectors, full intensity."
SULU,It's coming at light speed.
BAILEY,Collision course.
SPOCK,"Evasive maneuvers, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Object changing direction, too, sir. Keeps coming at us."
UHURA,"I'm getting no signal from it, sir."
BAILEY,Still collision course. Deflectors aren't stopping it.
SPOCK,Sound alarm.
SULU,"It's slowing down, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Countermand alarm. All engines full stop.
BAILEY,Visual contact.
SPOCK,"Ahead slow. Steer a course around it, Mister Sulu."
BAILEY,It's blocking the way!
SPOCK,"Quite unnecessary to raise your voice, Mister Bailey. All"
SULU,"Bridge to all decks. Condition alert. All decks, condition alert."
MCCOY,Just a few seconds more.
KIRK, Just a few seconds more.
MCCOY,"That's a boy. Keep it up. Work up a little sweat, it'll will do"
KIRK,You're killing me. You're killing me.
MCCOY,Stop. Winded?
KIRK,"You'd be the last one I'd tell. (sees light, goes to desk"
KIRK,What's that?
KIRK,A vessel of some kind?
KIRK,I'll be right up. You could see the alarm lights flashing from
MCCOY,"Finally finished a physical on you, didn't I.  What"
KIRK,Bridge. Captain to Bridge.
KIRK,Any changes?
KIRK,Any indication of danger from it?
KIRK,I'll change first then. Captain out.
SPOCK,"All decks have reported green, Mister Bailey."
BAILEY,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,And when the Captain arrives he will expect a full report on
BAILEY,The cube's range and position. I'll have it by then. Raising my

BAILEY,Very funny.
SULU,"You try to cross brains with Spock, he'll cut you to pieces every"
KIRK,Captain to Bridge.
KIRK,Any signs of life?
KIRK,Have you tried all hailing frequencies?
KIRK,Have the department heads meet me on the Bridge.
SPOCK,"Reporting, sir. Sensors show it is solid,"
KIRK,Lieutenant Uhura.
UHURA,"Hailing frequencies still open, sir. I get no message from it."
KIRK,Navigation.
BAILEY,"Distance from us, fifteen hundred ninety three metres, position"
SULU,"Each of its edges measures one hundred seven metres. Mass, a"
KIRK,Scotty.
SCOTT,Motive power? Beats me what makes it go.
KIRK,I'll buy speculation.
SCOTT,I'd sell it if I had any. That's a solid cube. How something
KIRK,Life sciences.
MCCOY,Same report.
BAILEY,"Sir, we going to just let it hold us here? We've got phaser"
KIRK,"I'll keep that in mind, Mister Bailey, when this becomes a"
KIRK,"Anything further, gentlemen?"
SPOCK,"I believe it adds up to either one of two possibilities. First,"
KIRK,Second?
SPOCK,Flypaper.
KIRK,And you don't recommend sticking around.
SPOCK,Negative. It would make us appear too weak.
KIRK,"It's time for action, gentlemen. Mister Bailey"
BAILEY,Bridge to Phaser Gun Crew
KIRK,Countermand. I'll select what kind of action.
BAILEY,"I'm sorry, sir. I thought you meant"
KIRK,Are you explaining Mister Bailey? I haven't requested an
BAILEY,"Yes, sir. We'll try pulling away from it."
SULU,"Yes, sir. Helmsman to Engine Room, stand by. All decks alert."
BAILEY,"Course plotted and laid in, sir."
KIRK,"Engage, Mister Sulu. Quarter speed."
SULU,"Point two five, sir. Still blocking us, sir."
KIRK,Let's see if it'll give way. Ahead half speed.
SULU,"Point five oh, sir."
SPOCK,Radiation from the short end of the spectrum increasing.
KIRK,All stop. Hold position.
BAILEY,"It's still coming toward us. Range, one hundred ninety metres."
SPOCK,Radiation increasing.
KIRK,"Power astern, half speed."
SULU,Half speed.
SPOCK,Radiation nearing the tolerance level.
BAILEY,"Still coming, gaining on us."
KIRK,"Engines astern, full speed."
SULU,Full speed.
BAILEY,Range one hundred twenty five metres now.
KIRK,"Helm, give us warp speed."
SULU,"Warp one, sir."
SPOCK,Radiation at the tolerance level.
SULU,"Warp two, sir. Speed is now warp three."
SPOCK,"Radiation passing the tolerance level, entering lethal zone."
BAILEY,"Range fifty one metres and still closing, sir."
KIRK,Phaser Crew stand ready.
BAILEY,"Phaser Crew reports ready, sir."
SPOCK,Growing. We can take only a few more seconds of this.
KIRK,"Lock phasers on target. Mister Bailey, lock phasers."
BAILEY,"Phasers locked on target, sir. At point-blank range and closing."
KIRK,Fire main phasers.
SPOCK,"Nothing, Captain. No contacts, no objects in"
KIRK,Care to speculate on what we'll find if we go on ahead?
SPOCK,"Speculate? No. Logically, we'll discover the intelligence which"
KIRK,Intelligence different from ours or superior?
SPOCK,"Probably both, and if you're asking the logical decision to make"
KIRK,"No, I'm not. The mission of the Enterprise is to seek out and"
SPOCK,Has it occurred to you that there's a certain inefficiency in

BAILEY,"Plotted. Laid in, sir."
KIRK,Engage.
BAILEY,"Warp one, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Bailey, phaser crews were sluggish. You were slow in"
SULU,"Yes, sir."
BAILEY,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,"Your timing is lousy, Jim."
MCCOY,Your men are tired.
KIRK,Captain's quarters. Aren't you the one who always says a little
MCCOY,I never say that.
MCCOY,I'm especially worried about Bailey. Navigator's position's
KIRK,I think he'll cut it.
MCCOY,"Oh? How so sure? Because you spotted something you liked in him,"
KIRK,"Why, Doctor, you've been reading your textbooks again?"
MCCOY,I don't need textbooks to know you could've promoted him too
KIRK,"What's next? They're not machines, Jim?"
MCCOY,"Well, they're not. After what they've been through they really"
should KIRK,"Doctor McCoy, I've heard you say that man is ultimately superior"
MCCOY,"No, I never say that, either."
KIRK,I could've sworn I heard you say that. Kirk here.
KIRK,"Let's try for one hundred, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,What are you going to do with that six percent when they give it
KIRK,"I'm going to take it, and I'm going to "
RAND,"Excuse me, sir. It's past time you had something to eat, sir."
KIRK,What the devil is this? Green leaves?
RAND,"It's dietary salad, sir. Doctor McCoy ordered your diet card"
MCCOY,"Your weight was up a couple of pounds, remember?"
KIRK,"Will you stop hovering over me, Yeoman?"
RAND,"Well, I'll change it if you don't like it, sir."
KIRK,"Bring some for the doctor, too."
MCCOY,"No, no. No, I never eat until the crew eats."
KIRK,"Thank you, Yeoman."
RAND,"You're welcome, sir. "
KIRK,When I find the headquarters genius that assigned me a female
yeomanMCCOY,"What's the matter, Jim. Don't you trust yourself?"
KIRK,I've already got a female to worry about. Her name's the
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,Coming.
SPOCK,Exceptionally strong contact. Not visual
SULU,"There, sir."
KIRK,Half speed. Prepare for evasive action.
SULU,"Reducing to warp two, sir."
SPOCK,"Tractor beam, Captain. Something's grabbed us, hard."
SULU,"Engines overloading, sir."
KIRK,All engines stop.
SULU,"All engines stopped, sir."
KIRK,Phaser crews stand ready.
BAILEY,"Bridge to phaser crews, stand ready."
SPOCK,Fascinating.
KIRK,"What's its mass, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Reading goes off my scale, Captain. Must be a mile in diameter."
BAILEY,"Over five thousand metres away, and it still fills the screen."
KIRK,Reduce image. Let me see all of it.
SULU,"Magnification two five, sir. Magnification one eight point five,"
KIRK,Ship to ship.
UHURA,"Hailing frequencies open, sir."
KIRK,This is the United Earth ship Enterprise. We convey greetings and
BAILEY,A message coming over my navigation beam.
KIRK,Pick it up.
UHURA,"Switching, sir."
KIRK,Ship to ship.
UHURA,"Hailing frequencies open, sir."
KIRK,This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. The warning
When we attempted to disengageSPOCK,"Captain, we're being invaded by exceptionally strong sensor"
SPOCK,"They're shutting off some of our systems, Captain. Brilliant."
KIRK,Does the recorder marker have this on its tapes?
SPOCK,Enough to warn other Earth ships.
KIRK,"Mister Bailey, dispatch recorder marker. Mister Bailey?"
BAILEY,"Recorder marker dispatched, sir."
SPOCK,Marker on course. Heading back the way we 
SPOCK,Might be interesting to see what they look like if I can locate
MCCOY,Balok's message. It was heard all over the ship.
KIRK,Captain to crew. Those of you who have served for long on this

KIRK,This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise. We came seeking
BAILEY,What? A course?
SULU,"Plotted and laid in, sir."
KIRK,"Engage, warp factor one."
SULU,Warp factor. There's no response.
KIRK,Switch to impulse.
SULU,"All engine systems show dead, and weapon systems."
SPOCK,Switching to screen. I believe I can get something visual.
SPOCK,I was curious to see how they appeared.
KIRK,"Yes, of course you were."
BAILEY,I don't understand this. Spock's wasting time. Everybody else
MCCOY,"Easy, Bailey."
BAILEY,What do they want from us? Let's find out what they want us to
KIRK,They want us to lose our heads.
BAILEY,We've only got eight minutes left.
SULU,Seven minutes and forty five seconds.
BAILEY,He's doing a countdown!
MCCOY,Practically end of watch.
BAILEY,"What, are you all out of your minds? End of watch? It's the end"
KIRK,"Bailey, you're relieved! Escort him to his quarters, Doctor."
MCCOY,Let's go. 
KIRK,Ship to ship.
UHURA,"Hailing frequencies open, sir."
KIRK,This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. It is the custom
SULU,"Four minutes, thirty seconds."
SCOTT,"You have an annoying fascination for timepieces, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,Jim.
KIRK,What's the matter with them out there? They must know we mean
SPOCK,They're certainly aware by now that we're totally incapable of
KIRK,"There must be something to do, something I've overlooked."
SPOCK,"In chess, when one is outmatched, the game is over. Checkmate."
KIRK,Is that your best recommendation?
SPOCK,"I'm s, I regret that I can find no other logical alternative."
MCCOY,"Assuming we get out of this, Captain"
KIRK,Nobody's given up yet.
MCCOY,"Well, then about Bailey. Let me enter it in my medical records"
KIRK,"That's my decision, Doctor."
MCCOY,"And your mistake. You overworked him, pushed him, expected too"
KIRK,"I'm ordering you to drop it. I have no time for you, your"
MCCOY,I intend to challenge your actions in my records. I'll state
KIRK,"Any time you can bluff me, Doctor."
KIRK,"All right, Doctor. Let's hope we have time to argue about it. Not"
UHURA,"Hailing frequencies open, sir."
KIRK,This is the Captain of the Enterprise. Our respect for other

SPOCK,"However, it was well played. I regret not having learned more"
SCOTT,Then may heaven have helped your mother.
SPOCK,Quite the contrary. She considered herself a very fortunate
KIRK,Doc. Sorry.
MCCOY,For having other things on your mind? My fault. I don't how the
SULU,One minute. I knew he would.  If anyone's

KIRK,Permission granted.
SULU,"Eleven, ten seconds, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three,"
SPOCK,"A very interesting game, this poker."
KIRK,It does have advantages over chess.
MCCOY,Love to teach it to you.
KIRK,Here it comes. Is it raise or call?
KIRK,Hold on that. Let him sweat for a change. Ship to ship.
UHURA,"Hailing frequencies, sir."
KIRK,Request denied.
SPOCK,"I have visual contact, Captain."
MCCOY,I thought the power was off in the galley.
RAND,"I used a hand phaser, and zap. Hot coffee."
SULU,"Something's going on, Captain. "
KIRK,It's a small ship.
SPOCK,About two thousand metric tons.
SPOCK,"Engine systems coming on, Captain."
SPOCK,Tractor beam again.
SULU,"We're being towed, sir."
BAILEY,"Captain, he's pulling out a little ahead of"
SPOCK,He's sneaked power down a bit.
SULU,Our speed is down to point six four of light.
KIRK,I want a right angled course. Shear away from him no matter which
BAILEY,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Maximum acceleration when I give the word.
SULU,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Engage.
SULU,"It's a strain, Captain. Engines are overloading."
KIRK,More power.
SPOCK,"We're superheating. Intermix temperature, seven thousand four"
KIRK,"Shear away, Mister Bailey."
SPOCK,"Two thousand degrees above maximum. Eight four, eight five,"
KIRK,"Now, Mister Sulu. Impulse power two."
BAILEY,"We're breaking free, sir."
KIRK,All engines stop.
SULU,"All engines stopped, sir."
SCOTT,"Engines need work badly, Captain. Can you hold it here a few"
SPOCK,That may not be wise. He got a signal through to the mother ship.
KIRK,Then we're not home yet.
UHURA,"A signal, Captain. It's very weak. It's Balok. It's a distress"
KIRK,Any reply?
UHURA,"Negative, sir. The signal is growing weak. Sir, I doubt if the"
KIRK,"Plot a course for it, Mister Bailey."
SPOCK,"For it, Captain?"
KIRK,Dead ahead. This is the Captain speaking. First Federation vessel
BAILEY,"Course plotted and laid in, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Scott, ready the transporter room."
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. "
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, bring us to within one hundred metres. Ahead slow."
SULU,"Ahead slow, sir."
MCCOY,"Jim, don't you think"
KIRK,"What's the mission of this vessel, Doctor? To seek out and"
BAILEY,Sir?
KIRK,The face of the unknown. I think I owe you a look at it.
BAILEY,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,"Captain, request permission to"
KIRK,"Denied. If I'm wrong, if it's a trap, I want you here."
KIRK,Transporter ready?
SCOTT,"Well, yes, sir, but it's risky. We're locked on what appears to"
KIRK,Air sample?
SCOTT,"Breathable. In fact, a slightly higher oxygen content than our"
KIRK,"Thank you, Scotty. Ready, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"No, but you won't let that stop you."
SCOTT,"Bend low, gentlemen. It reads pretty cramped over there. Ready"
KIRK,Energise.
KIRK,It's a dummy. A puppet of some kind.
BALOK,I'm Balok. Welcome aboard. (curtain opens to reveal a small
KIRK,I'm Captain Kirk.
BALOK,"And McCoy and Bailey. Sit. Be comfortable. Go ahead, be seated."
KIRK,Commander Balok.
BALOK,"I know, I know, a thousand questions. But first, the tranya."
KIRK,"Commander, that puppet."
BALOK,"My alter ego, so to speak. In your culture, he would be Mister"
BAILEY,Testing us?
KIRK,I see.
BALOK,I had to discover your real intentions.
KIRK,But you probed our memory banks.
BALOK,Your records could have been a deception on your part.
MCCOY,And your crew?
BALOK,"I have no crew, Doctor. I run everything, this entire complex,"
KIRK,Yes. Both our cultures would benefit. Do you know where we can
BAILEY,"Me, sir. I'd like to volunteer."
BALOK,"Ah. You represent Earth's best, then."
BAILEY,"No, sir, I'm not. I'll make plenty of mistakes."

BALOK," I see. We think much alike, Captain, you and I. Now,"

PIPER,"This base sent no message, Captain."
MENDEZ,"Oh, Jim, I just can't understand this."
KIRK,"Mister Spock received a starbase transmission, a message from the"
MENDEZ,Impossible.
KIRK,If my first officer states he received a transmission from
MENDEZ,"Jim, I'm not doubting anyone's word. I'm simply telling you"
KIRK,Why?
MENDEZ,You don't know? You actually don't know what's happened to
MENDEZ,You ever met Chris Pike?
KIRK,When he was promoted to Fleet Captain.
MENDEZ,"About your age. Big, handsome man, vital, active."
KIRK,I took over the Enterprise from him. Spock served with him for
SPOCK,"Eleven years, four months, five days."
MCCOY,"What's his problem, Commodore?"
MENDEZ,Inspection tour of a cadet vessel. Old Class J starship. One of
MCCOY,The delta rays?
MENDEZ,He went in bringing out all those kids that were still alive.
MENDEZ,Captain Pike. (a scarred head and shoulders

HUMBOLDT,"Chief Humboldt here, sir."
HUMBOLDT,"Yes, sir."
HUMBOLDT,"Negative, Commodore. We've checked and double-checked"
MENDEZ,"Oh, have I introduced Miss Piper, Jim? This"
PIPER,I recognized the Captain immediately. A mutual friend described
KIRK,Helen described
PIPER,"She merely mentioned she knew you, sir."
MENDEZ,"You have something to report, Miss Piper?"
PIPER,"Oh, yes, sir. I'm afraid our investigation turned up very"
KIRK,"Miss Piper, a Vulcan can no sooner be disloyal than he can exist"
PIPER,"We're forced to consider every possibility, sir. We can be"
MENDEZ,"And totally unable to move, Jim. His wheel chair is constructed"

HANSEN,Enterprise standing by. Request confirmation.
UHURA,Enterprise to Starbase. Request confirmation.

HANSEN,"Acknowledged, sir."
SPOCK,Stand by. We'll warp out of orbit in one

MCCOY,They've tried questioning him. He's almost agitated himself into
KIRK,How long will he live?
MCCOY,As long as any of us. Blast medicine anyway. We've learned to

MCCOY,"No to what? They could question him for days, weeks, before they"
KIRK,"Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock?"
MCCOY,"I don't read you at all, Jim."
KIRK,What I mean is either a message was received. It was one of two
MCCOY,"Jim, forgetting how well we both know Spock, the simple fact"
KIRK,He's also half human.
MCCOY,And that half is completely submerged. To be caught acting like
KIRK,Someone's interfering with my command and my ship. I don't know

SPOCK,"The Enterprise knows where she's going, Mister Hansen."
UHURA,"Someone's trying to hail us, sir."
SPOCK,"Maintain radio silence, Lieutenant. This is First Officer Spock."
MCCOY,What's going on around here? Who said Jim needed a medical rest
SPOCK,And no one from the ship made such a call.
MCCOY,That's right.

SPOCK,"May I inquire on what grounds, Captain?"
KIRK,A mutiny requires a trial board of no less than three command
Since there are only two of that rank availableSPOCK,"Sir, I must point out that there are three officers of command"
KIRK,Denied. Captain Pike is a complete invalid.
SPOCK,I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list.

SPOCK,I am.
MENDEZ,Why? What does it accomplish to go there or to take Captain
SPOCK,"Are your comments a part of the record, sir?"
MENDEZ,"Yes, it's on the record."
SPOCK,Thank you. Request monitor screen be engaged.
MENDEZ,For what purpose?
SPOCK,"To comply with the request you just made, sir, that I explain"
KIRK,"By asking why, you've opened the door to any evidence he may wish"
MENDEZ,Present your evidence. Screen on.
SPOCK,"This is thirteen years ago. The Enterprise and its commander,"
KIRK,"Screen off. Chris, was that really you on the screen? "

KIRK,Will he make it?
MCCOY,He's got a good chance.

KIRK,"All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it."
SPOCK,Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you.

STILES,Family history. There was a Captain Stiles was in the space

STILES,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,"Outpost two coming into sensor range, Captain."
KIRK,"Outpost 2 was the first to go silent, Lieutenant?"
UHURA,"Yes, Captain, then Outpost three an hour later."
SPOCK,Sweeping the area of Outpost two. Sensor reading indefinite.
KIRK,Open a channel to our nearest command base. Quarter hour reports
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Call battle stations, Mister Sulu."
SULU,Battle stations. All hands to battle stations. Battle stations.

SPOCK,"And showing on my sensors, Captain. At least it's still there."
UHURA,"Sir, regaining contact with Outpost four. Switching to speakers."
KIRK,"Kirk here. We're minutes away, Hansen. What's your status?"
KIRK,"Confirm what hit you, Hansen. What vessel? Identity?"
KIRK,Can you locate the intruder for us?

KIRK,"Affirmative. You're visual, Hansen. What do you have on the"
KIRK,Lock us onto your screen.
KIRK,Do you have phaser capacity? We're still out of range.

KIRK,Decoding?
UHURA,"Cryptography is working on it, sir."
STILES,Give it to Spock.
KIRK,"I didn't quite get that, Mister Stiles."

KIRK,Repeat it.
STILES,I was suggesting that Mister Spock could probably translate it

KIRK,"Well, here's one thing you can be sure of, Mister. Leave any"

SULU,"Turning, sir."
COMMANDER,We grow visible. Attend the cloaking system.
ROMULAN,"It consumes much power, Commander. With no enemy to concern"
COMMANDER,That Earth outpost called to an Earth vessel. Now it follows
ROMULAN,Which neither retreats nor grows nearer. It turns as we turn.
COMMANDER,"Perhaps so, but my judgment prevails."
ROMULAN,"Cloaking system on, sir."

SPOCK,"Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor."
KIRK,"Yes, well gentlemen, the question still remains. Can we engage"
SCOTT,No question. Their power is simple impulse.
KIRK,Meaning we can outrun them?
STILES,"To be used in chasing them or retreating, sir?"
KIRK,"Go ahead, Mister Styles. I called this session for opinions."
STILES,We have to attack immediately.
KIRK,Explain.
STILES,They're still on our side of the Neutral Zone. There would be
SULU,"Attack, without a visible target? How do we aim our phasers?"
STILES,"Aim with sensors. Not accurate, but if we blanket them"

SULU,And if they could report they destroyed us?
STILES,These are Romulans! You run away from them and you guarantee
KIRK,"Sit down, Mister."
SPOCK,I agree. Attack.
KIRK,Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight?
MCCOY,Based on what? Memories of a war over a century ago? On theories

SPOCK,"Yes, indeed we do, Mister Stiles. And if Romulans are an"

SPOCK,Do you want a galactic war on your conscience?
KIRK,Captain to Bridge.
KIRK,What's our position?
KIRK,Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports?
KIRK,And at this distance?
KIRK,"Thank you, Lieutenant. Check our course ahead, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"A comet, magnitude seven, dead ahead, and the intruder changing"
KIRK,Comet Icarus four. Composition?
SPOCK,"Quite ordinary. An ionised mass, a trail of frozen vapour"
KIRK,"And when an object passes through it, even an invisible object?"
SPOCK,It leaves a visible trail.
KIRK,"Our chance, gentlemen. Prepare to attack. All hands, battle"
MCCOY,"Amen to that. We're taking a big gamble, Jim."
KIRK,Battle status?
SULU,"All stations manned, Captain."
STILES,Phaser weapons energised. Set for proximity blast.
SPOCK,Intruder now bearing directly for comet's tail.
KIRK,"Plot his exact point of entry, Mister Stiles."
STILES,"Computed. On the board, sir."
KIRK,"The moment he begins entering the comet's tail, he becomes"
SULU,"Acknowledged, Captain."
SPOCK,"He's maintaining that bearing, Captain."

COMMANDER,Clear?
ROMULAN,Our reflection no longer follows us.
COMMANDER,"Escape manoeuvre one, quickly!"
SPOCK,"We're losing sensor contact, Captain."
KIRK,Steady as she goes. Phaser crews ready?
SULU,"Phaser crew signal ready, sir."
KIRK,He'll only be visible for a moment. Stand by.

ROBERT,"Phaser two, fire."
CREWMAN,"Phaser two, fire."
COMMANDER,Divert all power to weapons.
SULU,Phaser overload. Control circuit burnout.
SPOCK,"It'll take time to correct, sir."
SULU,"Captain, are they surrendering?"
KIRK,Full astern! Emergency warp speed!
KIRK,Do we have emergency warp?
SULU,"Full power, sir. It's still overtaking us. If we can get one"
KIRK,Navigation?
STILES,"Estimate it'll overtake us in two minutes, sir."
KIRK,"Phasers, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Impossible, Captain."
KIRK,Feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately.
RAND,"Captain, should I continue log entry?"
KIRK,Yeoman. Affirmative. Continue log entries.
RAND,"Yes, sir."
SULU,"Ten seconds to impact. Captain, It's dissipating, sir."
STILES,It must have a range limit.
SULU,"Five, four, three, two, one. Impact!"
KIRK,Limited range.
SPOCK,"Phasers operational, Captain. Intruder bearing one eleven mark"
KIRK,Back to his old course.
SPOCK,"He may think we're destroyed, Captain."
KIRK,I wouldn't make that assumption. I don't think their Captain will
SPOCK,Intruder holding steady. Course one eleven mark fourteen.
KIRK,"Same as before, Mister Sulu. Stay with him."
ROMULAN,"Commander, the reflection returns."
COMMANDER,Activate our cloak.
ROMULAN,"Commander, our fuel runs low."
COMMANDER,Quickly!
DECIUS,The Earth vessel? Impossible.
ROMULAN,It moves as we move.
COMMANDER,Its commander is not one to repeat a mistake.
STILES,"We'll enter the Neutral Zone in one minute,"
MCCOY,"Do we violate the treaty, Captain?"
SPOCK,"They did, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Once inside, they can claim we did. A set-up. They want war, we"
SPOCK,"We're still on our side, Captain."
KIRK,Let's get them while we are. Before we enter the Neutral Zone.
SULU,"Ahead, sir. Maximum."
KIRK,"Phasers, stand by."
STILES,"Sir, at this distance?"
KIRK,"We know their Achilles heel, Mister Stiles. Their weapon takes"
STILES,A phaser hit at this distance would be the wildest stroke of
KIRK,"I'm aware of that, Mister Stiles. Are phasers ready?"
STILES,"Phasers show ready, sir."
ROMULAN,Commander!
COMMANDER,Evasive action. The Earth ship again.
STILES,"Twenty seconds to Neutral Zone, sir."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, inform Command base, In my opinion, no option."
DECIUS,"Commander, they stay within range. I will"
COMMANDER,No need. The Centurion is dead.
DECIUS,"Why don't we fire, Commander?"
COMMANDER,"No. No, he's shrewd, this starship commander. He tries to"
DECIUS,"Yes, Commander."
COMMANDER,"The body of the Centurion, too. Forgive me, my old friend,"
SPOCK,Motion sensor signal stopped.
KIRK,Cease fire.
SULU,"Debris scatter ahead, sir. We've hit him."
SPOCK,"Vessel wreckage. Metal moulds, conduit, plastoform and a body,"
KIRK,However?
SPOCK,"Insufficient mass, sir."
KIRK,What?
SPOCK,"Simple debris. Not a vessel, a trick."
KIRK,Go to sensor probes.
SPOCK,"Nothing, sir. No motion out there at all. We've lost them,"
SPOCK,"Captain, I must make further repairs on the transfer coil. It's"
KIRK,"All right, Mister Spock, work quietly."
DECIUS,"Now twenty full cycles, Commander. Still no"
COMMANDER,"Shh. He is there, somewhere. I feel it."
RAND,"Can I get you something from the galley, sir? Coffee, at least?"
KIRK,"Thank you, Yeoman. Bring it to the Bridge. I'll be there in a"
RAND,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,I wish I were on a long sea voyage somewhere. Not too much deck

KIRK,"No, I don't really expect an answer."
MCCOY,"But I've got one. Something I seldom say to a customer, Jim. In"

KIRK,It's all right. It's all right.
ROMULAN,"A signal, Commander."
COMMANDER,We have him. Move toward him.
KIRK,Power on. Reverse course. He'll try to slip

COMMANDER,Place one with the debris. Proximity fuse.
DECIUS,"Yes, Commander. At once."
SULU,"More wreckage, sir, scattering across our"
KIRK,Cease fire.
SPOCK,Debris on our scanners.
KIRK,"Analysis, quickly."
SPOCK,"Same type as before, sir, except, one metal-cased object!"
KIRK,"Helm, hard over. Phasers, fire point-blank."
STILES,"Phasers, fire!"
DECIUS,Glorious. Glorious.
COMMANDER,Now we go home.
DECIUS,"They're at our mercy. Commander, I remind you of your duty."
KIRK,Captain to Sickbay.
KIRK,Casualties?
KIRK,"Thank you, Doctor.  Report, Mister"
SPOCK,"Nuclear device of some kind, sir. Our phasers detonated it less"
KIRK,Ship damage?
SPOCK,Mainly overloads and circuit burnouts.
KIRK,Weapons status?
KIRK,"Fully operable, Scotty?"
STILES,"Sir, my first assignment was in weapons control."
KIRK,"Go. Lieutenant Uhura, take over navigation."
UHURA,"Yes, Captain."
SPOCK,"We have engine power now, Captain, if you'd like to move off and"
KIRK,Maybe we can pull them back to our side of the Neutral Zone. Hold
DECIUS,"Still no sign of movement, Commander."
COMMANDER,We've damaged ourselves. Our fuel reserve is gone.
DECIUS,And it is our duty to crush the Praetor's enemies.
COMMANDER,I do not trust their Captain.
DECIUS,"We are in the Neutral Zone. They will not enter. If you refuse,"
COMMANDER,"We will attack, but on my order."
SPOCK,"Damage reports, Mister Stiles?"
STILES,Negative.
SPOCK,Will you require assistance here?
STILES,"This time, we'll handle things without your help, Vulcan."
STILES,Tomlinson!

SPOCK,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. After what this ship has been"
KIRK,"Have Doctor McCoy's report channeled to my quarters, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"Aye, aye, Captain."
SULU,"Beautiful, beautiful. No animals, no people,"
MCCOY,I couldn't have prescribed better. We are one weary ship.
SULU,Do you think the Captain will authorise shore leave here?
MCCOY,Depending upon my report and that of the other scouting parties.
SULU,He'd like it.
MCCOY,"He needs it. You've got your problems, I've got mine. He's got"
SULU,"To get some cell-structure records. A blade of grass, a bush, a"
RABBIT,"Oh, my paws and whiskers! I'll be late."
ALICE,"Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a rather large white rabbit with a"
ALICE,Thank you very much.
MCCOY,Sulu!
SULU,What is it? What's the matter?
MCCOY,Did you see them?
SULU,"See what? I don't see anything. What is it, Doc?"
KIRK,"Captain's log. Stardate 3025 er, point 3. We are orbiting an"
TONIA,"Sir, I don't see your name in any of the shore parties."
KIRK,"I may be tired, Yeoman, but I'm not falling apart. Dismissed."
TONIA,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, we're beaming down the starboard section first."
SPOCK,"Not necessary in my case, Captain. On my planet, to rest is to"
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,"Yes. Open a channel, Uhura."
MCCOY,"Captain, are you beaming down?"
KIRK,"I hadn't planned to, Bones. Why?"
MCCOY,"Well, either our scouting probes and"
KIRK,Explain.
MCCOY,"On this supposedly uninhabited planet, I"
KIRK,That's pretty good. I got one for you. The rabbit was followed by
MCCOY,"As a matter of fact, yes."
KIRK,"All right, Doctor, I'll take your report under consideration."
SPOCK,"Very well, Captain. Something I did come to discuss."
KIRK,"Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?"
SPOCK,I picked this up from Doctor McCoy's log. We have a crewmember
KIRK,That's much too low a rating.
SPOCK,"He's becoming irritable and quarrelsome, yet he refuses to take"
ve found KIRK,A crewman's right ends where the safety of the ship begins. That
SPOCK,"James Kirk. Enjoy yourself, Captain. It's an interesting planet."
TELLER, Does it always have to be work with you? There's so
RODRIGUEZ,You won't find all this so lovely if our report for the
KIRK,"Rodriguez, Teller, everything all right?"
RODRIGUEZ,"Yes, sir. We've completed the specimen survey."
KIRK,Good. That should be sufficient. Beam it up to Mister Spock when
RODRIGUEZ,"Thank you, sir. And sir, I think you'll find Doctor McCoy"
KIRK,Thank you.
KIRK,"Restful. After what we've been through, it's hard to believe a"
TONIA,"It is beautiful. So lovely, and restful. I mean, affirmative,"
KIRK,McCoy! McCoy!
MCCOY,Over here. Over here.
KIRK,"Bones, know any good rabbit jokes lately?"
MCCOY,"As a matter of fact, I do, but this is not one of them. Look at"
KIRK,Footprints. Could be a rabbit. It would have to be an unusual
MCCOY,Negative. He was examining the flora at the time.
KIRK,"Bridge, this is the Captain."
TONIA,Where is Mister Sulu?
MCCOY,Collecting specimens.
KIRK,Has the first shore party beamed down yet?
UHURA,"Negative, Captain. They're just about to start."
KIRK,Get this message to all shore parties. Stand by. No one is to
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
MCCOY,"You're cancelling the shore leave on account of this, Jim?"
KIRK,"You're the doctor, Doctor. Can you explain this?"
MCCOY,"Well, no."
KIRK,Neither can I. I admit it looks harmless. It probably is
KIRK,What do you think you're doing?
SULU,"Target shooting, Captain. Isn't it a beauty? Haven't got anything"
KIRK,"Where did you get it, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,"I found it. I know it's a crazy coincidence, but I've always"
KIRK, Mister Sulu.
SULU, It fires lead pellets propelled by expanding
KIRK,I'll hang on to it. The fresh air seems to have made you
TONIA,"Doctor McCoy's rabbit, sir. He must have gone through here."
KIRK,Are you sure our instruments didn't show any animal life on this
MCCOY,"Absolutely. No birds, no mammals, no insects, nothing. I'm"
KIRK,"I'd like to believe this is an elaborate gag, but. Yeoman"
KIRK,This is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave.
MCCOY,"Well, it could have been worse."
KIRK,How?
MCCOY,You could have seen the rabbit.
KIRK,"What's the matter, Bones, you getting a persecution complex?"
MCCOY,"Well, yeah, I'm beginning to feel a little bit picked on, if"
KIRK,I know the feeling very well. I had it at the Academy. An upper
MCCOY,And you being the very serious young
KIRK,"Serious? I'll make a confession, Bones. I was absolutely grim,"
MCCOY,A girl's footprints. The young blonde girl I saw chasing it.
KIRK,Yes. You follow the rabbit. I'll backtrack the girl. I'll meet
MCCOY,"Good. I've got a personal grudge against that rabbit, Jim."
FINNEGAN, Jim.
KIRK,Finnegan? I can't believe it.
FINNEGAN,"You never know when I'm going to strike, huh, Jim? (hits him"
KIRK,"All right, let's try that one again. Go!"
FINNEGAN,"Go! Any excuse, Jim baby. Run away! Run away! Run away!"
MCCOY,What was it?
KIRK,Yeoman Barrows.
KIRK,What happened?
TONIA,"I don't know. I mean I do know. I was following the tracks, and"
KIRK,Who was?
TONIA,Him.
KIRK,"Barrows, give me a report."
TONIA,"He had a cloak, sir, and a dagger with jewels on it."
KIRK,Are you sure you're not imagining all this?
TONIA,"Captain, I know it sounds incredible, but I did not imagine it"
MCCOY,Sounds like Don Juan.
TONIA,"Yes. Yes. It was so sort of story book walking around here, and"
KIRK,Mister Sulu was with you. Where is he now?
TONIA,He ran after him.
KIRK,"Stay with her, Doctor."
KIRK,Mister Sulu! Sulu!
KIRK,Mister Sulu! Sulu!
KIRK,Sulu!
KIRK,Ruth? Ruth.
RUTH,"Jim, darling, it is me. It is Ruth."
KIRK," McCoy, do you read me?"
RUTH,It doesn't matter. None of that matters.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,What?
KIRK,"No, but I'm sure he's all right."
KIRK,"Yes, I'm fine."
KIRK,"Yes, Mister Rodriguez."
KIRK,"Don't you like birds, Mister Rodriguez?"
KIRK,"Mister Rodriguez, have the search parties rendezvous at the"
RUTH,You have to go?
KIRK,I don't want to.
RUTH,You'll see me again if you want to.
KIRK,You haven't told me. You haven't told me
RUTH,"Do what you have to do, and I'll be waiting."
KIRK,Ruth.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,"Yes, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,I'm getting strange readings from the planet
KIRK,Specify.
KIRK,Can you pinpoint the source?
SPOCK,Could be coming from beneath the planet's
KIRK,"Keep me posted, Mister Spock. We'll continue"
MCCOY,Feeling better?
TONIA,"A little, but I wouldn't want to be alone here."
MCCOY,"It's a beautiful place. A little strange, I'll admit."
TONIA,"That's just it. It's almost too beautiful. I was thinking, even"
MCCOY,"I see what you mean, but then you'd have whole armies of Don"
TONIA,"Is that a promise, Doctor?"
TONIA,"Oh, Doctor, they're lovely. Look at me, Doctor. A lady to be"
MCCOY,You are all of those things and many more. They'll look even
TONIA,"Doctor, I'm afraid."
MCCOY,"Now, look, I don't know how or why, but the dress is here. I'd"
TONIA,"All right, but you stay right there. Don't peek."
MCCOY,"My dear girl, I am a doctor. When I peek, it's in the line of"
MCCOY,McCoy here. I can't read you very well. Is this Rodriguez?
MCCOY,Right. What the devil's wrong with communications? Esteban.
RODRIQUEZ,Doctor. Doctor. Doctor McCoy!
KIRK,First there was McCoy's Alice in Wonderland
SPOCK,Any chance these could be hallucinations?
KIRK,One hallucination flattened me with a clout
SPOCK,That sounds like a painful reality.
KIRK,Yes.
SPOCK,Your signal is very weak. Can you turn up
SPOCK,"Captain, shall I beam down an armed party?"
KIRK,Negative. Our people here are armed with
KIRK,"McCoy. McCoy, do you read me? Kirk to McCoy."
SULU,"Captain, take cover! There's a Samurai after me."
KIRK,A what?
SULU,"I mean, there was.  Captain, you've"
KIRK,I do. I've met some interesting personalities myself. Have you
SULU,Got a call a few minutes ago. Rodriguez. Said you were
KIRK,I hope he got through to everybody. Communications are almost out.
SULU,That's not all. So's my phaser.
KIRK,Yeah. We'd better get to
SULU,"Yes, sir.  Look. Someone beaming"
KIRK,Trying to. Something's obstructing it. (finally the familiar
SPOCK,"Necessary, Captain. Unable to contact you by communicator, and"
KIRK,Good. We can use your help.
SULU,"We're stranded down here, Captain?"
KIRK,Until we can find out what this is all about.
TONIA,There's no one here.
MCCOY,This is where the Captain said to rendezvous. (makes Tonia stand
TONIA,Don't talk like that.
MCCOY,"A princess shouldn't be afraid, not with a brave knight to"
KIRK,That way. Spread out. Let's find it.
MCCOY,These things cannot be real. Hallucinations can't harm us. Go
TONIA,He's dead.
TONIA,It's my fault. It never would have happened.
KIRK,No.
TONIA,"It is, it is. I'm to blame."
KIRK,Yeoman! We're in trouble. I need every crewman alert and thinking.
TONIA,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU, Captain! Captain!
SULU,"You'd better have a look at this, sir. (the knight is a plastic"
KIRK,"Neither do I, Mister Sulu, but before we leave this planet, I"
SULU,"It's like a dummy, Captain. It couldn't be alive."
KIRK,Tricorder?
SULU,"Still operating, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Spock. (Spock and Sulu swap places, handing over the"
SPOCK,"This is not human skin tissue, Captain. It more closely"
KIRK,"I want an exact judgment, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,This is definitely a mechanical contrivance. It has the same

SPOCK,I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings. The

SPOCK,All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real
TELLER,What is it?
RODRIGUEZ,Of all the crazy things. Remember what I was telling you a
TELLER,Can it hurt us?
RODRIGUEZ,Not unless it makes a strafing run.
TELLER,A what?
RODRIGUEZ,The way they used to attack people on the ground. (the plane
RODRIGUEZ,Angela.
SULU,Captain!
KIRK,McCoy's body?
SULU,He's gone. Dragged off.
TONIA,"The black knight, too."
KIRK,Spock?
SPOCK,"At this point, Captain, my analysis may not sound very"
KIRK,McCoy's death is a scientific fact.
SPOCK,"There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless."
KIRK,"I was, I was thinking about the Academy. My days"
FINNEGAN,"Hey, Jim baby! I see you brought out reinforcements. Ha!"
KIRK,Finnegan. Finnegan! What's been happening to my people?
KIRK,Take Sulu. Find McCoy's body. This man is my problem.
SPOCK,"Captain, wait."
KIRK,"That's an order, Mister Spock."
FINNEGAN,Here I am! Run!
FINNEGAN,Jim! Find me! Can't you see me? Come and
Jim KIRK,I want some answers.
FINNEGAN,Coming up.
FINNEGAN,"Get up. Get up. Get up. Always fight fair, don't you? True"
FINNEGAN,I can't move me leg. I can't feel me leg. My back is broken.
KIRK,Can you feel that?
FINNEGAN,"Can you feel that, now?  Sleep sweet, Jimmy"
FINNEGAN,"Won't you ever learn, Jim boy? You never could take me, you"
KIRK,Finnegan. One thing
FINNEGAN,Sure. Name it.
KIRK,Answers.
FINNEGAN,Earn them!
FINNEGAN,"Not bad. Kind of makes up for things, huh, Jim?"
KIRK,A lot of things. What's been happening to my people?
FINNEGAN,"I never answer questions from plebes, Jimmy boy."
KIRK,"I'm not a plebe. This is today, fifteen years later. What are you"
FINNEGAN,"I'm being exactly what you expect me to be, Jimmy boy."
SPOCK,"Did you enjoy it, Captain?"
KIRK,"Yes, I enjoyed it. After all these years.  I"
SPOCK,Which supports a theory I've been formulating.
KIRK,That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be
SPOCK,"Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly"
KIRK,Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about
SPOCK,Yes. We must all control our thoughts.
KIRK,Difficult.
SPOCK,"The force field we encountered is obviously underground,"
when Rodriguez thought of a tiger KIRK,Spock.
KIRK,We've got to get back to the landing party and warn them.
KIRK,"Sulu, Rodriguez, Barrows. Front and centre."
SULU,Sir.
KIRK,"Don't ask any questions, Sulu. Face front, everyone. Don't talk."
SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,Who are you?
CARETAKER,"I'm the caretaker of this place, Captain Kirk."
KIRK,You know my name?
CARETAKER,"But of course. Lieutenant Rodriguez, Lieutenant Sulu, Yeoman"
KIRK,Amuse? That's your word for what we've been through?
CARETAKER,But none of this is permanent. Here you have to only imagine
SPOCK,The term is amusement park.
CARETAKER,Of course.
SPOCK,An old Earth name for a place where people could go to see and
CARETAKER,This entire planet was constructed for our race of people to
SULU,"Play? As advanced as you obviously are, and you still play?"
KIRK,"Yes, play, Mister Sulu. The more complex the mind, the greater"
CARETAKER,"Exactly, Captain. How very perceptive of you."
KIRK,But that still doesn't explain the death of my ship's surgeon.
MCCOY,"Possibly because no one has died, Jim. (Strolls in with a lovely"
TONIA, And how do you explain them?
MCCOY,"Oh. Them. Well I, er, I was thinking about a little cabaret I"
TONIA,And so am l.
MCCOY,"Oh, yes. So you are. Well, girls, I suppose you can turn"
CARETAKER,We regret that some of you've been made uncomfortable.
KIRK,You say your people built all this. Who are you? What planet are
CARETAKER,My impression is that your race is not yet ready to
SPOCK,I tend to agree.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,"No, everything is in order, Lieutenant. Stand by."
CARETAKER,However.
CARETAKER,"If you would use the proper caution, this amusement planet"
MCCOY,"It's what the doctor ordered, Jim."
KIRK,Lieutenant.
KIRK,Commence transporting shore leave parties. Tell them to prepare
SPOCK," Captain, I'll go back aboard"
KIRK,"No, Mister Spock. I'll go. You. (then he sees Ruth walking"
SPOCK,"Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen?"
KIRK,"Yes, we did, Mister Spock. I think we did."
MCCOY,"Indeed we did, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Most illogical.
KIRK,"Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu."
Original Airdate,"5 Jan, 1967"
KIRK,"Captain to shuttlecraft Galileo. Stand by,"
FERRIS,"I remind you, Captain, I'm entirely opposed to this delay. Your"
KIRK,"No problem, Commissioner. And may I remind you that I have"
FERRIS,I don't like to take chances. The plague is out of control on

SPOCK,Position?
LATIMER,"Three point seven. Sir, I"
SPOCK,"Make up your mind please, Mister Latimer."
LATIMER,"Sir, this indicator's gone crazy."
BOMA,"That's to be expected, Mister Spock. Quasars are extremely"
SPOCK,"Considerably, Mister Boma."
MEARS,"Mister Spock, radiation is increasing."
SPOCK,"Stop forward momentum, Mister Latimer."
LATIMER,"I can't, sir. Nothing happens."
SPOCK,"Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please."
BOMA,"Ionic interference, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,We're being drawn right into it.
SPOCK,Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. We are out of
KIRK,Anything at all?
UHURA,"Nothing clear, Captain. Just a few words about being pulled off"
KIRK,Try and get me a fix on the Galileo.
SULU,"Scanners are blank, Captain. We're getting a mass of readings"
COMPUTER,Negative ionic concentration one point six four times ten to
FERRIS,"What is it, Captain?"
KIRK,That thing out there has ionized this complete sector. None of
FERRIS,I was opposed to this from the very beginning. Our flight to
KIRK,"I'm aware of that, Commissioner. At the same time I have certain"
FERRIS,"Yes, but you've lost your crew."
KIRK,We have two days to find them.
FERRIS,Two days? ln all that? Two days?
KIRK,"What would you have me do, turn around and leave them there?"
FERRIS,You shouldn't have sent them out in the first place. Do you know what you've done? You've
UHURA,"Captain, there's one planet in this solar system capable of"
KIRK,"Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Set course for Taurus Two.
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
FERRIS,You said something about a needle in a haystack. It's useless.
KIRK,"If they're not there, Commissioner, then they're dead by now."
MCCOY,You all right?
GAETANO, Yes.
MCCOY,Scotty? Boma?
BOMA,Now that's what I call a ride.
MCCOY,Yeoman?
MEARS,Yes. I just got a little bump on the head.
MCCOY, Upsy-daisy.
MEARS,Thank you.
MCCOY,What happened?
BOMA,"I can't be sure, but I'd say that, the magnetic potential of the"
SPOCK,"I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mister Boma."
SCOTT,What a mess.
SPOCK,"Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mister"
SCOTT,"You don't really expect to get an answer, do you?"
SPOCK,"I expect nothing, Mister Scott. It is merely logical to try all"
MCCOY,"Partial pressure of oxygen, seventy millimetres of mercury."
SPOCK,"Just the facts, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Traces of argon, neon, krypton, all in acceptable quantities."
SPOCK,Thank you for your opinion. It will be duly noted. You're
MEARS,"Of course, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Mister Scott, if you'll make a survey of the damage, please."
SCOTT,Logical.
SPOCK,"Gentlemen, I think we should move outside, make room for Mister"
LATIMER,"Aye, aye, sir."
MCCOY,What do you think our chances are of contacting the Enterprise?
SPOCK,"Under present conditions, extremely poor."
MCCOY,But they'll be looking for us.
SPOCK,"If the ionisation effect is as widespread as I believe it is,"
MCCOY,Then you don't think they'll find us.
SPOCK,Not as long as we're grounded. We may be here for a very long
UHURA,"Nothing, Captain."
KIRK,Mister Sulu.
SULU,"Yes, Captain?"
KIRK,Anything on your scanners?
SULU,"Totally inoperative, sir. No readings at all."
KIRK,Have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power?
SULU,"Yes, sir. No change."
KIRK,"Transport room, this is the captain speaking. Are the"
KIRK,"Thank you. This is the captain speaking. Flight deck, prepare"
UHURA,"All wavelengths dominated by ionisation effects, sir."
FERRIS,"Well, Captain?"
KIRK,"We have until 2823.8 to continue the search, Commissioner."
FERRIS,"You don't really think you'll have any luck, do you?"
KIRK,"Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates. I intend to"
FERRIS,"Very well, Captain, but not one second beyond that moment. Is"
KIRK,"I'm familiar with the regulations, Commissioner. I know all about"
MCCOY,"Well, I can't say much for the circumstances, but at least it's"
SPOCK,"My big chance? For what, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"Command. Oh, I know you, Mister Spock. You've never voiced it,"
SPOCK,"I am a logical man, Doctor."
MCCOY,It'll take more than logic to get us out of this.
SPOCK,"Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin. I realise"
SCOTT,"Very bad, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,In what way?
SCOTT,We've lost a great deal of fuel. We have no chance at all to
SPOCK,The weight of three grown men.
SCOTT,"Aye, you could put it that way."
MCCOY,Or the equivalent weight in equipment.
SPOCK,"Doctor McCoy, with very few exceptions we use virtually every"
BOMA,You mean three of us must stay behind.
SPOCK,"Unless the situation changes radically, yes."
BOMA,And who's to choose?
SPOCK,"As commanding officer, the choice will be mine."
BOMA,You wouldn't be interested in drawing lots?
SPOCK,"A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better"
BOMA,"All right, Mister Spock. Who?"
SPOCK,"My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical"
MCCOY,"Mister Spock, life and death are seldom logical."
SPOCK,"But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor. Now gentlemen, I"
BOMA,"If any minor damage was overlooked, it was when they put his head"
MCCOY,"Not his head, Mister Boma, his heart. His heart."
LATIMER,What is it?
GAETANO,II don't know. It's from up there.
LATIMER,"No, it's from back there."
GAETANO,It's everywhere. It's all around us!
LATIMER,Let's get out of here.
SPOCK,"Come on, Boma."
SPOCK,What was it?
GAETANO,"It was something huge, terrible. Up there. I think I hit it."
BOMA,Did you see what it was?
GAETANO,Vaguely. It was like a giant ape.
BOMA,Poor Latimer.
GAETANO,At least it was quick for him.
BOMA,We'll get off all right.
SPOCK, Nothing there.
GAETANO,I tell you there was.
SPOCK,I don't doubt your word.
GAETANO,But there must be something. I swear I hit it.
SPOCK,
BOMA,Sir?
SPOCK,There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered
BOMA,Not very efficient? Is that all you have to say?
SPOCK,"Am I in error, Mister Boma?"
BOMA,You? Error? Impossible.
SPOCK,"Then what, Mister Boma?"
BOMA,"There's a man lying there dead, and you talk about stone spears."
SPOCK,"My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister"
GAETANO,"Mister Spock. In the interest of efficiency, I don't think we"
SPOCK,Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our
I GAETANO,"We'll do it. Give me a hand with Latimer, will you?"
UHURA,"Captain, the Columbus has returned from"
KIRK,Have them proceed to the next quadrant. Any word from engineering
UHURA,"They're working on them, sir. Still inoperable."
KIRK,What about the transporters?
UHURA,They're still reported unsafe.
KIRK,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
FERRIS,Captain.
KIRK,"Yes, Commissioner?"
FERRIS,I don't relish the thought of abandoning your crewmen out
however I must remind you KIRK,"I haven't forgotten, Commissioner."
FERRIS,You're running out of time.
KIRK,"I haven't forgotten that, Commissioner. This is the captain. Try"
KIRK,"Uhura, order the Columbus to open its course two degrees on every"
SULU,"But Captain, two degrees means they'll be overlooking more than a"
KIRK,It also means we have a fighting chance to cover the majority of
SULU,"Yes, sir."
FERRIS," Twenty four more hours, Captain."
SPOCK,Perhaps if you were to channel the second
SCOTT,It's too delicate. It may not be able to take the pressure as it
MCCOY, This should save us at least
SPOCK,"Excellent, Doctor."
MEARS,We should be able to scrape up another hundred pounds.
SPOCK,Which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds
MCCOY,I can't believe you're serious about leaving someone behind. Now
s out there SPOCK,"It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six, Doctor."
MCCOY,I'm not talking about rationality.
SPOCK,You might be wise to start.
BOMA, Mister Spock. we're ready.
SPOCK,For what?
BOMA,The services for Latimer.
SPOCK,"Mister Boma, we're working against time."
BOMA,The man's dead. He deserves a decent burial. You're the captain.
SPOCK,"Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion."
MCCOY,"Mister Spock, that's your place."
SPOCK,"My place is here. If you please, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Now look. We may all die here. At least let us die like men, not"
SPOCK,"By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our"
SCOTT,If you'll give me a hand with this conduit.
SCOTT,Pressure's dropping. We're losing everything.
SPOCK,What happened?
SCOTT,One of the lines gave. The strain of coming through the
SPOCK,That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind.
SCOTT,We have no fuel! What alternatives?
SPOCK,"Mister Scott, there are always alternatives."
MCCOY,Mister Spock! Something's happening outside.
MCCOY,"What do those supersensitive ears make of that, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,Wood rubbing on some kind of leather.
GAETANO,They're getting ready. They'll attack.
BOMA,"Not necessarily. It could be a simple tribal rite, assuming a"
SPOCK,Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More
MEARS,If we knew more about them
BOMA,"We know enough. If they're tribal, they'll have a sense of unity."
SPOCK,"How, Mister Boma?"
BOMA,By hitting them hard. Give them a bloody nose. Make them think
GAETANO,"Yes, I agree. If we stand by and do nothing, we're just giving"
SPOCK,I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for
GAETANO,"Well, we're practical about it. I say we hit them before they"
SPOCK,Mister Boma?
BOMA,Absolutely.
SPOCK,Doctor McCoy?
MCCOY,Seems logical to me.
SPOCK,"It does, indeed. It seems logical to me, also. But to take life"
GAETANO,The majority.
SPOCK,"I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Mister"
GAETANO,That could get us killed.
SPOCK,I think not. Doctor McCoy.
MCCOY,Yes.
SPOCK,You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship. Assist Mister Scott in
MCCOY,Right.
SPOCK,"Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only"
GAETANO,Now you're talking.
SPOCK,"We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill."
GAETANO,"Oh, for the. You saw what they did to Latimer!"
SPOCK,"I am in command, Mister Gaetano. The orders and the"
BOMA,The mists. I can't see them.
SPOCK,"I hear them. They're directly ahead of us. Several, I believe."
GAETANO,I say we hit them dead on.
SPOCK,"Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim"
SPOCK,Fire.  Cease fire.
GAETANO,I still say we should have killed them.
SPOCK,It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done.
MEARS,Did you find them?
SPOCK,"Yes, we found them. They won't bother us again."
MCCOY,I hope not. Scotty has an idea.
SCOTT,"It's dangerous, but it might work."
SPOCK,"Go, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,I can adjust the main reactor to function with a substitute fuel
SPOCK,"That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply."
SCOTT,"Aye, we do. Our phasers. I can adapt them and use their energy."
MCCOY,"Trouble is, they happen to be our only defence."
SPOCK,They would also seem to be our only hope.
SCOTT,Aye.
SPOCK," Yeoman, your phaser."
MEARS,But what if the creatures attack again?
SPOCK,"They won't attack for at least several hours. By then, with"
SCOTT,"If I can get a full load, we should be able to achieve orbit"
SPOCK,"We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott. In less"
SCOTT,"Aye, aye, sir."
CHIEF,"They came back all right, sir. In my opinion, the transporters"
KIRK,"Good. This is the captain. Landing parties one, two, and three,"
CHIEF,"Captain, it's a big planet. It'll be sheer luck if our landing"
KIRK,"I'm depending on luck, Lieutenant. It's almost the only tool we"
SPOCK,"Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor."
BOMA,"Nobody knows what's happened to Gaetano, and you hand over his"
SPOCK, And give this to Mister Scott in
MCCOY,Just where are you going?
SPOCK,I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of
MCCOY,I don't know. He'll risk his neck locating Gaetano and if he
BOMA,Do you really think the ship will ever leave?
MCCOY,"Well, it won't unless we get these phasers back."
MCCOY,"Well, Mister Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did"
SPOCK,Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons.
MCCOY,You mean they should have respected us?
SPOCK,Of course.
MCCOY,"Mister Spock, respect is a rational process. Did it ever occur"
SPOCK,"Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability."
MCCOY,They were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling. You
MEARS,Why haven't they done anything?
SPOCK,"They're studying us, for the moment."
BOMA,"Another prediction, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"My opinion, Mister Boma."
SPOCK,Seal the windows!
MCCOY,"Studying us, Mister Spock? They seem to learn rather quickly."
BOMA,"All right, Spock, you have all the answers. What now?"
SPOCK,"Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile."
BOMA,"My tone isn't the only thing that's hostile, Mister Spock!"
SPOCK,Curious. Most illogical.
BOMA,I'm sick and tired of your logic!
MEARS,We could use a little inspiration.
SPOCK,"Strange. Step by step, I have made the correct and logical"
MCCOY,And you've brought our furry friends down on us.
SPOCK,"I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated"
SPOCK,"How much longer, Mister Scott?"
SCOTT,"Another hour, maybe two."
MCCOY,That won't be long enough.
SCOTT,"Doctor, a phaser can only drain so fast."
BOMA,How long do you think those plates will hold out under this?
SCOTT,You've got your hands full.
KIRK,What word from the sensor section?
UHURA,At last report they were getting some readings
KIRK,I'm not interested in the last report. I want to know now.
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
FERRIS,"You have two hours and forty three minutes, Captain."
KIRK,I'm perfectly aware of how much time I have left.
FERRIS,I'm delighted. However I shall continue to remind you.
KIRK,You do that.
UHURA,"Sir, sensor section reporting. Static interference still"
KIRK,What about radio communication?
UHURA,Clearing slowly. Still incapable of transmission or reception.
FERRIS,What do you intend to do?
KIRK,"Do? I intend to continue the search. Foot by foot, inch by inch,"
FERRIS,"I'm sure the authorities will be pleased by your diligence,"
KIRK,"I'm in command here, Mister Ferris."
FERRIS,"You are, Captain. For another two hours and forty two minutes."
SPOCK,"Mister Scott, how much power do we have left"
SCOTT,"They're in good shape, but they won't lift us off, if that's"
SPOCK,Will they electrify the exterior of this ship?
SCOTT,"That they will, Mister Spock!"
SPOCK,Get to the centre of the ship. Don't touch the plates. Be sure
SCOTT,"Ready, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,All right. Go. (Scott uses a spanner or something to short out
SCOTT,I daren't use any more. Not and be sure of ignition.
SPOCK,I believe we've used enough. Mister Scott. I suggest you
SCOTT,Aye.
MCCOY,It must've worked.
SPOCK,For the moment.
BOMA,For the moment?
SPOCK,"The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be"
BOMA,Mister Gaetano's body's back there.
SPOCK,It will of course have to be left behind.
BOMA,Not without a burial.
SPOCK,I wouldn't recommend it. The creatures won't be far away.
BOMA,"Not without a burial, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril.
BOMA,"I'll take that chance. You see, Mister Spock, I would insist upon"
MCCOY,Mister Boma.
BOMA,I'm sick and tired of this machine!
SCOTT,That's enough!
SPOCK,"Gentlemen. All right, Mister Boma, you'll have your burial,"
UHURA,"Captain Kirk, landing party number two has"
KIRK, Put Lieutenant Kelowitz on visual.
KIRK,Report.
KIRK,There are casualties?
I KIRK,"Thank you, Lieutenant. You'd better report to Sickbay yourself."
FERRIS,"Captain Kirk, check your chronometer. You'll see that it is"
KIRK,But they're still out there.
FERRIS,"So are the plague victims on New Paris. I'm sorry, Captain. I"
KIRK,The Columbus hasn't returned yet. I still have two search parties
FERRIS,"You're procrastinating, Captain. You have your orders. Recall"
KIRK,Lieutenant.
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search
UHURA,"I'm in partial contact with them now, sir."
KIRK,"Then have them return immediately. Mister Sulu, prepare to"
UHURA,"Captain, the sensor section says the beams"
KIRK,What about the other systems?
UHURA,"No, sir. Too much interference."
SULU,"Captain, course set for Makus Three."
KIRK,"Stand ready, Mister Sulu. How long before the Columbus comes on"
UHURA,"Twenty three minutes, sir."
KIRK,Twenty three minutes.
MEARS,"Enterprise, this is Galileo. Come in,"
SCOTT,That's it.
SPOCK,How about weight?
SCOTT,"If we shed every ounce, we might be able to achieve orbit."
SPOCK,And how long can we hold it?
SCOTT,"A few hours, no longer. But if we time it right, we can cut out"
SPOCK,To land here again? Not a very attractive possibility.
SCOTT,"We have very few alternatives, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Doctor McCoy. Mister Boma. When can we lift off, Scott?"
SCOTT,Maybe eight minutes if the weight's right.
SPOCK,"Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes. You"
UHURA,"The Columbus is aboard, sir. The flight"
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, proceed on course for Makus Three, at space normal"
SULU,"Space normal, sir?"
KIRK,"Those are my orders. Lieutenant Uhura, order all sensor sections"
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,Get into the ship! Immediate lift off!
SPOCK,No! Go back! Lift off! Go back! No!
SPOCK,"All right, All right! Go! Go! Go! Go!"
SPOCK,"Go, Scott!"
SCOTT,"Aye, aye, sir."
SPOCK,I told you to lift off!
MCCOY,"Don't be a fool, Mister Spock. We couldn't leave you out there."
SPOCK,"Get us off, Scott!"
SCOTT,"We should be moving, but we're not."
SPOCK,"Quite right, Mister Scott. There's somebody holding us down. All"
SCOTT,What are you doing?
SPOCK,Our boosters.
SCOTT,We'll never be able to hold orbit.
SPOCK,Would you rather stay here?
SCOTT,"No, Mister Spock."
MEARS,We're moving!
BOMA,They let go!
MCCOY,We got off!
SPOCK,"May I remind you we have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we"
SPOCK,"Gentlemen, by coming after me, you may well have destroyed what"
MCCOY,"Mister Spock, remind me to tell you that I'm sick and tired of"
SPOCK,"That is a most illogical attitude. Orbit in one minute, Mister"
SCOTT,"Fifteen pounds psi. Approximately enough for one orbit, sir."
MCCOY,After that?
SCOTT,Tapping our boosters ended our last chance for a soft landing.
BOMA,You mean a burn-up?
SPOCK,It is the usual end of a decaying orbit.
MEARS,I don't want to die up here.
SPOCK,Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on
BOMA,I admire your ability to make so measured a choice.
SCOTT,"Mister Spock, you said a while ago that there were always"
SPOCK,Did l? I may have been mistaken.
MCCOY,"Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that. Is there"
SPOCK,The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now. I for
MCCOY,"Well, Mister Spock, so ends your first command."
SPOCK,Yes. My first command.
SCOTT,"Orbit attitude, Mister Spock. With our present fuel, that gives"
SPOCK,"Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please."
SCOTT,Mister Spock!
MEARS,What happened?
SCOTT,He jettisoned the fuel and ignited it.
BOMA,We need that fuel to maintain orbit. Are you out of your mind?
SPOCK,"Perhaps, Mister Boma."
MCCOY,"How long have we got now, Scotty?"
SCOTT,The orbit'll start decaying as soon as the fuel's exhausted. Say
SULU,"Captain, there's something there on screen, at Taurus Two."
KIRK,"Sensors, a meteorite?"
SULU,No. It's holding a lateral line. There it is again. Holding
KIRK,"A hundred and eighty degrees about, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant"
SCOTT,A distress signal? It's like sending up a
SPOCK,No one out there to see it.
SCOTT,"Orbit decaying, Mister Spock. Ten seconds to atmosphere."
MCCOY,"It may be the last action you'll ever take, Mister Spock, but it"
SPOCK,Totally illogical. There was no chance.
MCCOY,That's exactly what I mean.
MEARS,It's getting hot.
UHURA,"Transporters locked in, sir."
KIRK,Activate beams.
SULU,"Whatever it was, Captain, it just burned up in the atmosphere."
UHURA,"Captain, transporter room just beamed up five persons. Alive and"
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, proceed on course to Makus Three. Ahead warp factor"
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir. Warp factor one."
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,There's really something I don't understand about all of this.
SPOCK,"Quite correct, Captain."
KIRK,"Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that"
SPOCK,"Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles,"
KIRK,I see. You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional
SPOCK,"Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but"
KIRK,"You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life,"
SPOCK,"No, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, you're a stubborn man."
SPOCK,"Yes, sir."
Original Airdate,"12 Jan, 1967"
DESALLE,"All clear ahead, Captain. The sensors indicate zero register."
KIRK,"Forward readings, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Gravimetric readings, no significant change, zero space density."
KIRK,"Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu. Colony Beta Six wants their"
MCCOY,"Void, star desert. The word conjures up pictures of dunes,"
KIRK,"Sunlight, palm trees. We're nine hundred light years from that"
SPOCK,"The precise meaning of the word desert is a waterless, barren"
MCCOY,"That doesn't surprise me, Mister Spock. I can't imagine a mirage"
SPOCK,"Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Moving on schedule into quadrant nine"
KIRK,"Something, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Unusual, Captain. I'm now getting a sizable space-displacement"
KIRK,"Can you verify that, Navigator?"
DESALLE,"No, sir. Forward sweeps are negative. Wait. Verified, sir. We"
KIRK,Put it on visual.
DESALLE,"Iron-silica body, planet sized, magnitude one E. We'll be"
SPOCK,Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on all our records.
KIRK,"And yet, here it is. No time to investigate. Science stations,"
UHURA,"Strong interference on subspace, Captain. The planet must be a"
KIRK,"Let's get out of its range. Veer forty degrees to starboard,"
SULU,Forty degrees.
KIRK,Sulu!
DESALLE,"Mister Spock, they're gone!"
SPOCK,Emergency! Full reverse power!
SCOTT,We've searched again from stem to stern. If they're not down on
DESALLE,"No sign of human life on the surface, sir. Unless the"
SPOCK,"Function is normal. Continuous sensor sweeps. Lieutenant Uhura,"
UHURA,"All of them, Mister Spock. No response."
DESALLE,"With due respect, sir. Request permission to transport to the"
MCCOY,I second DeSalle's request. What are we waiting for?
SPOCK,"The decision will be mine, Doctor. I have the responsibility for"
JAEGER,"No detectable soil or vegetation. Extremely hot, toxic"
SPOCK,Estimate survival time of two unprotected individuals down
JAEGER,Not very long.
UHURA,Mister Spock. Look.
SPOCK,"Greetings and felicitations. Hmm. Send this, Lieutenant. USS"
SPOCK,Hip hip hoorah? And I believe it's pronounced tally ho.
DESALLE,"Some kind of a joke, sir?"
SPOCK,"I'll entertain any theories, Mister DeSalle. Any at all."
MCCOY,One thing is certain. Obviously there's life on that planet.
SPOCK,"You're quite correct, Doctor. Prepare transporter room."
SCOTT,"Request assignment to the search party, sir."
SPOCK,"No, Mister Scott. Neither you nor I can be spared here. Mister"
SPOCK,Very good. Transmit coordinates to Mister Scott. Once on the
SCOTT,"Ready, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Activate.
MCCOY,"Where are your storms, Jaeger?"
JAEGER,Atmosphere exactly the same as ours.
DESALLE,DeSalle to Enterprise. DeSalle to Enterprise. It doesn't
MCCOY, No response.
DESALLE, Keep trying with yours. Something's blocking the
DESALLE,Mister Jaeger! McCoy!
MCCOY,"In the name of heaven, where are we?"
DESALLE,Look.
MCCOY,There's no reading. They're like waxworks figures.
TRELANE,"I must say, they make a perfectly exquisite display pair, but"
SULU,Where are we?
TRELANE,Welcome to an island of peace on my stormy little planet of
KIRK,What happened? Fill me in.
MCCOY,You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu. We've been looking
TRELANE,"You must excuse my whimsical way of fetching you here, but"
KIRK,I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise.
TRELANE,"Ah, so you're the Captain of these brave lads. My greetings"
KIRK,Who are you? Where do you come from?
DESALLE,"We've lost contact with the ship, Captain. We're trapped here."
TRELANE,I can't tell you how delighted I am to have visitors from the
JAEGER,"Notice the period, Captain. Nine hundred light years from"
TRELANE,"Ah, yes. I've been looking in on the doings on your lively"
KIRK,Then you've been looking in on the doings nine hundred years
TRELANE,"Oh, really? Have I made an error in time? How fallible of me."
KIRK,General Trelane.
TRELANE,"Retired, sir. Just Squire Trelane now. And you may call me"
KIRK,For what purpose have you imprisoned us here?
TRELANE,"Imprisoned? Nonsense. You're my guests. You see, I just"
KIRK,"Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest. When we do battle,"
TRELANE,"Ah, but that's the official story, eh?"
KIRK,I must ask you to let us go back to our ship.
TRELANE,I wouldn't hear of it. You shall join me in a repast. I want
KIRK,"Not yet. Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle."
TRELANE,"DeSalle, did you say? Un vrai Francais?"
DESALLE,"My ancestry is French, yes."
TRELANE,"Ah, monsieur. Vive la gloire. Vive Napoleon. You know, I"
KIRK,"This is Mister DeSalle, our navigator. Doctor McCoy, our medical"
TRELANE,"Welcome, good physicianer and honourable sir. "
SULU,Is he kidding?
TRELANE,"Und Offizier Jaeger, und der deutsche Soldat, nein? (gives a"
JAEGER,"I'm a scientist, not a military man."
TRELANE,Oh come now. We're all military men under the skin. And how we
TRELANE,What an interesting weapon you've got there. Do let me see it.
TRELANE,"Oh, how marvellous!  Devastating!"
KIRK,"Who will you start with, my crew? Are we your next targets?"
TRELANE,"Oh, how absolutely typical of your species. You don't"
KIRK,That's correct.
TRELANE,"We, meaning I and others, have, to state the matter briefly,"
KIRK,Like the transporter system aboard the Enterprise.
TRELANE,"Oh, a crude example of an infinitely more sophisticated"
KIRK,"This drawing room, did you create it by rearranging matter on"
TRELANE,Quite.
KIRK,I see. How did you manage
TRELANE,"Dear Captain, your inquiries are becoming tiresome. I want you"
KIRK,"Come on, let's go. We're getting out of here."
TRELANE,"Tut, tut, tut. You're being quite rude. You can't go."
SCOTT,"Aye, it's there, Mister Spock. Peaceful as"
SPOCK,"I don't, Mister Scott. It simply exists. Artificial perhaps, or"
SCOTT,"Aye, it could, but it couldn't move around much."
SPOCK,Apply a fine tuning on our sensors. Locate any life forms in
SCOTT,"If we find any, it doesn't follow that it would be our people."
SPOCK,"Affirmative. But if the Captain is down there and alive, that's"
SCOTT,"Shooting in the dark, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Or stand by and do nothing, Mister Scott."
SULU,"Captain, where could he possibly come from? Who is this maniac?"
MCCOY,"Better say, what is he? I monitored him, and what I found was"
KIRK,Not alive?
MCCOY,Not in the way we define life. No trace. Zero.
SULU,"You mean, it shows he's dead?"
MCCOY,"It doesn't even show that he exists at all, alive or dead."
JAEGER,"Notice the wood fire, Captain? Burning steadily, ember bed"
KIRK,"Fire without heat, mistaking all this for present day Earth"
TRELANE,"Discussing deep laid plans, I'll wager. I cannot wait to see"
KIRK,"Trelane, we haven't planned"
TRELANE,Tut tut. Do not think that I deplore your martial virtue of
KIRK,"If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our"
TRELANE,"Oh, I can't let you go now. I was getting a bit bored until"
KIRK,For how long?
TRELANE,"Until this is over, of course."
KIRK,Until what is over?
TRELANE,"Dear Captain, so many questions. Make the most of an uncertain"
KIRK,"Trelane, even if we wanted to stay, our companions are missing"
TRELANE,"Yes, I must experience your sense of concern, your grief at"
KIRK,There are four hundred men and women aboard that ship.
TRELANE,Women? Do you mean that you actually have members of the
KIRK, No.
TRELANE,No?
KIRK,This game has gone on long enough. Those are crucial operating
t TRELANE,I can do anything I want. I should think you would have
MCCOY,"Captain, receiving a transporter signal."
TRELANE,Transporter signal? What does he mean? You must tell me!
KIRK,"It means, Trelane, the party's over, thanks to Mister Spock."
TRELANE, Wait! I won't have this! I
KIRK,"Everyone to stations. Report, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"They didn't, Captain. Not clearly. We merely beamed up all life"
MCCOY,"Which means Trelane is not a life form as we know it, or he'd be"
KIRK,Prepare to warp out of here at once. Maximum speed.
ROSS," Oh, Captain, I was so"
KIRK,"Scotty, we're going to need every ounce of your engines. We're"
MCCOY,"I'm quaking, but I don't know if it's from laughter or terror."
UHURA,"Doctor, what was it? What was down there?"
MCCOY,"Well, it was a. Oh, forget it."
ROSS,Look.
TRELANE,"Where are all your weapons, Captain? Don't you display your"
KIRK,Trelane.
TRELANE,"Don't fret, Captain. I'm only a bit upset with you, but this"
SPOCK,I am Spock.
TRELANE,"Surely not an officer. He isn't quite human, is he?"
SPOCK,My father is from the planet Vulcan.
TRELANE,And are its natives predatory?
SPOCK,Not generally. But there have been exceptions.
TRELANE,Really? You will see to his punishment?
KIRK,On the contrary. I commend his action.
TRELANE,But I don't like him.
KIRK,Get off my ship.
TRELANE,"Oh, rot! You're all going back with me."
KIRK,We're not going anywhere.
TRELANE,Nonsense. I have an absolutely enchanting sojourn on Gothos
TRELANE,And tasteful. Don't you agree?
SULU,No.
TRELANE,"But so much more fitting, honourable sir."
DESALLE, You
KIRK,DeSalle.
TRELANE,"Oh, what primitive fury. Why, he's the very soul of sublime"
KIRK,"Trelane, let him go."
SULU,We haven't even got our phasers.
TRELANE,"Yes, of course. I forget that I shouldn't frighten you too"
KIRK,This is General Trelane.
TRELANE,"Retired. But if you prefer, you may address me as the lonely"
KIRK,Lieutenant Uhura of communications.
TRELANE,Ah a Nubian prize.  Taken on one of your
KIRK,No doubt.
TRELANE,She has the melting eyes of the queen of Sheba. The same
KIRK, Yeoman Teresa Ross. I believe you have met
TRELANE,"You do realise, don't you, that it's in deference to the"
SPOCK,Affirmative.
TRELANE,I don't know if I like your tone. It's most challenging.
SPOCK,I object to you. I object to intellect without discipline. I
TRELANE,"Oh, Mister Spock, you do have one saving grace after all."
UHURA,I don't know how to play this.
TRELANE,Of course you do.
SULU,"Captain, how far do we go along with this charade?"
KIRK,"Until we can think our way out. Meanwhile, we accept his"
MCCOY,You should taste his food. Straw would taste better than his
SPOCK,"It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical."
MCCOY,There's that magic word again. Does your logic find this
SPOCK,"Fascinating is a word I use for the unexpected. In this case, I"
KIRK,"You don't find this unexpected, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"That his food has no taste, his wine no flavour? No. It simply"
KIRK,"And if he's fallible, he can't be all powerful. Which means he"
SPOCK,Evidently.
KIRK,A machine? A device? Something which does these things for him.
TRELANE,"Ah, my dear, don't we make a graceful pair? Except for one"
TRELANE,"Ah, yes, that's more what we want. The dashing warrior and his"
KIRK,"That mirror. It's part of his audience, his ego. He never wanders"
SPOCK,"Is it ego, or something else?"
KIRK,Explain.
SPOCK,The mirror.
KIRK,What about it?
SPOCK,You noted yourself he never gets very far from it. I suppose it
KIRK,"No, no, Mister Spock, that's not the reason. What kind of a"
SPOCK,A machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by
SPOCK,I think not. A device capable of keeping out this planet's
KIRK,Good. I agree. That leaves me free
SPOCK,"Free, Captain?"
KIRK,"If I'm not mistaken, Mister Spock, I think I can turn his lights"
TRELANE,"I overheard that remark, Captain. I'm afraid I'll have to"
KIRK,You only heard part of it. I just started.
TRELANE,Oh?
KIRK,Yes. I want you to leave my crewmen alone. I want you to leave my
TRELANE,"Does it actually make you angry, Captain?"
KIRK, I don't want you accepting his
ROSS,"Captain, please don't do this."
TRELANE,"Well, I do believe the dear Captain is jealous of me."
KIRK,"I don't care what you believe, just keep your hands off her!"
TRELANE,"Oh, how curiously human. How wonderfully barbaric."
KIRK,I've had enough of your insulting attentions to her.
TRELANE,"Of course you have. After all, that's the root of the matter,"
KIRK,"If it's fighting that you want,  you may have it."
TRELANE,Are you challenging me to a duel?
KIRK,If you have the courage.
TRELANE,"Oh, this is better than I'd planned. I shall not shirk an"
TRELANE,A matched set. Just like the pair that slew your heroic
TRELANE,"Oh, how fascinating. I'm party to an"
KIRK,Are you ready?
TRELANE,"Quite ready, sir. We shall test each other's courage and then,"
KIRK,Enough talk. Let's get on with it.
TRELANE,"As you will, sir. Honour will be served, eh? Oh, wait! As the"
KIRK,We shoot together.
TRELANE,"It's my game and my rules, but if you need to be persuaded."
KIRK,All right.
SPOCK,Captain.
TRELANE,"And now, Captain, how do you have the expression? My fate is"
TRELANE,You've ruined everything!
SPOCK,The machine.
DESALLE,"Captain, subspace interference is clearing."
KIRK,Try to contact the ship.
TRELANE,"Oh, the remarkable treachery of the species."
KIRK,"Go on, Trelane. Look at it. It's over. Your power is blanked out."
TRELANE,"You've earned my wrath. Go back. Go back to your ship, all of"
KIRK,"Trelane! Everyone, we're getting out of here. Now. This is the"
KIRK,Set course for Colony Beta Six.
SULU,"Laid in, sir."
KIRK,"Full power acceleration from orbit, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Standing by to warp, sir."
UHURA,"Shall I make a full report to Spacefleet Command, sir?"
KIRK,Not yet. They may trace our beam. Wait until we're well out of
SPOCK,"Can we know his range is, Captain?"
KIRK,We can take an educated guess. At the point we entered their
UHURA,"Still no sign of pursuit. Instruments clear, sir."
KIRK,Good.
ROSS,May I take a moment to change?
KIRK,"Yes, I think you might. Turn in your glass slippers. The ball is"
ROSS,"Gladly, Captain."
KIRK,Hard to believe it ever happened.
SULU,"Captain, we're about to warp."
DESALLE,Large body ahead.
SPOCK,Collision course.
KIRK,"Hard to port, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,"That was the planet Gothos, Captain."
KIRK,"Gothos? Mister Sulu, have we been going in circles?"
SULU,"No, sir. All instruments show on course."
SPOCK,"Gothos again, Captain."
KIRK,"Hard over, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,Cat and mouse game.
KIRK,With us as the mouse.
DESALLE,There it is again. Dead ahead.
KIRK,"Ninety degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Turning, Captain. Nut not veering off from it."
KIRK,"Ninety degrees sub-port, Mister Sulu. Adjust."
SULU,"Turn completed, and still accelerating toward the planet."
SPOCK,Or it toward us.
KIRK,Decelerate into orbit. Prepare transporter room.
MCCOY,"Captain, you're not beaming down."
KIRK,"Yes, I am, Doctor McCoy. I am going to see our playful Mister"
TRELANE,The prisoner may approach the bench.
KIRK,Trelane.
TRELANE,Any attempt at demonstrations will weigh against you with the
KIRK,I've had enough of your games.
TRELANE,"Oh, the absurdity of these inferior beings. (reading from the"
KIRK,"I haven't come to plead in your court, Trelane."
TRELANE,I warn you. Anything you might say has already been taken down
KIRK,I've come for one purpose. To get back my ship.
TRELANE,Irrelevant.
KIRK,"We've made you angry with our will to survive, haven't we?"
TRELANE,Uncalled for.
KIRK,Then vent your anger on me alone. I was the one who led the
TRELANE,And did you really think that was the only medium of
KIRK,I took that chance. I'm willing to pay the price for chancing
TRELANE,"Oh, then you do admit to the charge?"
KIRK,"Yes, anything! Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey."
You pompous TRELANE,Immaterial!
KIRK,Those people have done you no harm.
TRELANE,Inadmissible!
KIRK,"We're living beings, not playthings for your amusement."
TRELANE,"Silence! This trial is over. You are guilty. On all counts,"
TRELANE,"Until a moment ago, I didn't think it"
KIRK,I'm glad you weren't disappointed.
TRELANE,"Why, Captain, you're still angry. Would that I could have"
KIRK,"Trelane, if you think I'm going to cheerfully and obediently"
stick my head in that noose TRELANE,"You still haven't learned. You have no choice. Oh, this is"
KIRK,"That's your problem, Trelane. Everything is easy. It's given you"
TRELANE,"Take care, now."
KIRK,Here you have an opportunity to experience something really
TRELANE,The sport?
KIRK,Yes. The terror of murder. The suspense. The fun.
TRELANE,"Oh, I'm intrigued. Go ahead, Captain. What do you suggest?"
KIRK,"A personal conflict between us. Not like the duel before, but the"
TRELANE, Yes! Yes!
KIRK,That's the idea.
TRELANE,"Oh, then you approve?"
KIRK,"Yes, but you can do better than that. There's still not enough"
TRELANE,I know. That will be dull. We'll have to have something more
KIRK,It strikes me very well. But you'll have to make it worth my
TRELANE,The stakes?
KIRK,"Yes. While we're playing our game, free my ship. Let it continue"
TRELANE,Always back to your ship. Oh well. If it will add spice to the
KIRK,Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go.
TRELANE,Ah-ha!
TRELANE,"Ah ha! Captain Kirk. You must try harder, Captain. This is too"
KIRK,"Enterprise. Enterprise, can you hear me?"
TRELANE,"Touche, Captain. Touche. I must confess you scored first. But"
TRELANE,And now let's have at it again!
KIRK,Enterprise. Enterprise.
TRELANE,Ah-ha! Tallyho!  You made a noble
KIRK,"Remember, Trelane. You promised to let my ship go."
TRELANE,"Yes, but this is such sport. I must fetch all the others back"
KIRK,"You haven't won, Trelane."
TRELANE,I have. I could run you through!
KIRK,But you haven't won anything.
TRELANE,"On your knees, Captain!"
KIRK,No! Does it still taste as sweet?
TRELANE,I order you. You've been beaten.
KIRK,But I'm not defeated.
TRELANE,I order you! I order you! (Kirk disarms him and snaps the
KIRK,"You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane."
TRELANE,You dare to defy me!
KIRK,"In fact, you've got a lot to learn about everything, haven't you?"
TRELANE,I'll fix you for that! You cheated! You haven't played the
MOTHER,Trelane.
TRELANE,No! No. You said I could have this planet.
FATHER,This has gone far enough.
TRELANE,You always stop me when I'm having fun.
FATHER,You're disobedient and cruel. We've told you before.
MOTHER,"Time to come in now, Trelane."
TRELANE,"But I don't want to come in, and I won't. I'm a general, and I"
FATHER,"Enough, Trelane. Come along."
TRELANE,But why? I didn't do anything wrong. I was just playing.
FATHER,"We said, come along."
TRELANE,But I haven't finished studying my predators yet.
FATHER,This is not studying them.
MOTHER,"If you cannot take proper care of your pets, you cannot have"
TRELANE,"Oh, but I was winning. I was winning."
FATHER,"They're beings, Trelane. They have spirit. They're superior."
TRELANE,"No, no. You saw."
MOTHER,"You'll grow up, Trelane. You'll understand. Now come along."
TRELANE,"Oh, but you said I could. You promised. I never have any fun."
FATHER,"Stop that nonsense at once, or you'll not be permitted to make"
TRELANE,"Oh, but you saw. I was winning. I would have won. Honest."
FATHER,"No, Trelane."
MOTHER,"No, Trelane."
TRELANE,I would have. I would have. I would have. I would. I would. I
FATHER,"Captain, we regret that the life paths of yourself and your"
KIRK,Who are you? Who is Trelane?
MOTHER,You must forgive our child. The fault is ours for indulging him
FATHER,We would not have let him intercept you had we realised your
MOTHER,"Forgive us, Captain. We will maintain your life-support"
KIRK,Captain to Enterprise. Captain to Enterprise.
KIRK,"Beam me up, Mister Spock. We're free to go."
SULU,"Warping down, Captain. Our warp factor four."
DESALLE,"Approach channels clear, Captain."
UHURA,"Colony Beta Six clears us for normal approach, sir."
KIRK,"Normal orbit approach procedures, Mister Sulu."
SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,"Mister Spock. Still thinking about Trelane, is that it?"
SPOCK,"For the record, how do we describe him? Pure mentality? Force of"
KIRK,"God of war, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,I hardly find that fitting.
KIRK,"Then a small boy, and a very naughty one at that."
SPOCK,It will make a strange entry in the library banks.
KIRK,"Then he was a very strange small boy. One the other hand, he was"
SPOCK,"Mischievous pranks, Captain?"
KIRK,Yes. Dipping little girls' curls in inkwells. Stealing apples
KIRK,"Forgive me, Mister Spock. I should have known better."
SPOCK,"I shall be delighted, Captain."
Original Airdate,"19 Jan, 1967"
KIRK,You'll enjoy Commodore Travers. He sets a good table.
MCCOY,I wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to
KIRK,Probably. Rank hath its privileges.
MCCOY,How well we both know that.
KIRK,Scotty. Kirk here.
KIRK,"Good, Commodore. We're on our way."
KIRK,"We'll beam down immediately, Commodore. Kirk out."
SPOCK,Captain. I wonder why he's insistent that our tactical aides
KIRK,"This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of now here. He"
SPOCK,"Perhaps, Captain, but nevertheless"
MCCOY,"Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for his"
SPOCK,"Doctor, you are a sensualist."
MCCOY,"You bet your pointed ears I am. Ready whenever you are, Captain."
KIRK,Energise.
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise. Red alert.
KIRK,Cestus Three has been destroyed.
KIRK,"Full alert. Tricorder readings, Mister Spock. Life detection."
SPOCK,"Those messages we got, Captain, the one directing us here"
KIRK,Faked. All this happened several days ago. (to a man in a yellow

KIRK,"Come on, Bones."
MCCOY,"Captain, over there."
MCCOY,"Careful, careful. Shock, radiation burns, internal injuries for"
KIRK,"Keep him alive, Bones. I want to know what's been happening here."
SPOCK,"Getting another life reading, Captain."
KIRK,Survivors?
SPOCK,"Not survivors. Not warm-blooded. Living creatures, but not human."
KIRK,Where?
SPOCK,"Azimuth ninety three degrees, range one five seven zero yards."
KIRK,O'Herlihy.
HERLIHY,"Captain, I see something."
KIRK,"Cover! Kirk to Enterprise, lock on transporters. Beam us up."
SULU,"Captain, we're coming under attack."
KIRK,Keep those screens up. Fire all phasers.
SULU,"Firing phasers, Captain. The alien has"
KIRK,Take all action necessary to protect the
SULU,"Are you under attack, Captain?"
KIRK,Keep those screens up. Worry about us when the ship is safe.
KIRK,"If they lower those screens to beam us up, they'll be open to"
SPOCK,"We're hopelessly outnumbered here, Captain. It's those"
KIRK,"We're stuck with it, Mister Spock. We'll have to make do with"
KIRK,"Kelowitz, Lang, flank out. Lay down fire on co-ordinates Mister"
KIRK,We're helpless down here. And the Enterprise
SPOCK,Sulu is an experienced combat officer.
KIRK,"It's my ship, Mister Spock. I should be there. We can't even get"
SPOCK,Nor can they at us at the moment. Not unless they moved their
KIRK,Can you remember the layout of this place? The arsenal?
SPOCK,About one hundred yards in that direction. But after an attack
as thorough as this oneKIRK,I'll risk it.
KIRK,Kirk here. Report.
SULU,"Captain, are you all right?"
KIRK,Never mind about me. What about the ship?
SULU,We returned fire with all phaser banks.
KIRK,Arm your photon torpedoes.
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir. Arm photon torpedoes. Stand"
KIRK,Any identification on the attacking vessel?
SULU,We can't get visual contact. She's too far
DEPAUL,"Mister Sulu, photon torpedoes locked on."
SULU,"Photon torpedoes locked on, Captain."
SULU,"All banks fired, sir."
KIRK,"Sulu. Sulu, our communications are being"
SULU,"Clear, Captain, but you"
KIRK,Never mind about me. Protect my ship!
SULU,"Yes, sir. Photon torpedoes negative, Captain."
KIRK,Good. Contact me when you can. Kirk out.
SPOCK,"How is he, Doctor?"
MCCOY,He'll be dead in half an hour if we don't get him some decent
SPOCK,They're moving. I've got to get to the Captain.
SPOCK,"Locked on to the enemy, Captain. They're moving toward the high"
SPOCK,Very ingenious. They fed back my own impulses and built up an
KIRK,"We'll see how ingenious they are. Here, give me a hand with this"
SPOCK,Any word from the Enterprise?
KIRK,Sulu's taken her out of orbit.
KELOWITZ,"They got Lang, sir."
KIRK,Did you see them?
KELOWITZ,"No, sir."
KIRK,"An evaluation, Mister Kelowitz. Where do you think they are?"
KELOWITZ,"If I were them, I'd go to the high ground on the right. I"
KIRK,It'll be a lot closer to them. Stand clear.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,"Lock on to the alien, Mister Sulu. I don't want to lose her."
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir. Our screens are down. We can"
KIRK,I want a search party of thirty medical
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,Can you tell me what happened?
MAN,Scanners reported a ship approaching. We get them now and then.
KIRK,"Yes, I know."
MAN,"They came in space normal speed, using our regular approach route,"
KIRK,Easy. Easy.
MAN,"They poured it on, like, like phasers, only worse, whatever they"
KIRK,"Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from"
MAN,"They hit us a full day before you got there, Captain. No messages"
KIRK,It was a trap. Getting the Enterprise to come
SPOCK,Very clever. As to the reason?
KIRK,The reason is crystal clear. The Enterprise is the only
SPOCK,"You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof"
KIRK,I have all the proof I need on Cestus Three.
SPOCK,"Not necessarily, sir. Several possible explanations"
KIRK,"How can you explain a massacre like that? No, Mister Spock. The"
SPOCK,"Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make certain that"
KIRK,"I intend to. If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength,"
KIRK,Is the alien still making warp five?
KIRK,Initiate warp six.
KIRK,"Overtake. Phaser banks, lock on to the enemy vessel. Stand by for"
KIRK,Mister DePaul.
DEPAUL,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Position.
DEPAUL,"Twenty two point three parsecs beyond latest chart limit, sir."
KIRK,All scanners lock into computer banks. I want a complete record
SPOCK,"Virtually nothing, Captain. No records of any explorations."
KIRK,Anything on intelligent life forms?
SPOCK,"Nothing specific, Captain. Unscientific rumours only. More like"
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, status, alien vessel."
SULU,"They must be aware we're after them, sir. They've gone to warp"
KIRK,Warp factor seven.
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"Something the matter, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous, Captain."
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock. I mean to catch them."
SCOTT,"We'll either catch them or blow up, Captain. They may be faster"
KIRK,"They'll have to prove it. Yes, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain?"
KIRK,Of course.
SPOCK,I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.
KIRK,"Colony Cestus Three has been obliterated, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony,"
KIRK,"If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other"
SPOCK,I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life
KIRK,"There's no time for that. It's a matter of policy. Out here,"
SPOCK,"Very clear, Captain."
KIRK,"I'm delighted, Mister Spock. Report, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Alien ship maintaining interval, Captain. Now at warp seven."
KIRK,Warp factor eight.
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,Captain to phaser banks. All components at battle ready. All
SULU,Captain.
KIRK,"Yes, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Closing on target, sir."
KIRK,Good. Mister DePaul.
DEPAUL,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Our position.
DEPAUL,"Two two seven nine pl, sir. Uncharted solar system at two four"
KIRK,Is it on the alien's course?
DEPAUL,"No, sir. He's headed away from it."
UHURA,"Captain, sensors report we're being scanned."
KIRK,By the alien ship?
UHURA,"No, sir. It's from that solar system ahead."
KIRK,Any interference? Resistance?
UHURA,"No, sir, Just scanning beams. It's on an unusual wave length."
KIRK,Mister Spock?
SPOCK,It would appear someone is curious about us.
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar"
SULU,"Yes, sir. We're closing, sir."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?"
UHURA,"There's no hostility, sir. They're not tractors or weapons of"
SULU,Captain!
KIRK,"Yes, what is it?"
SULU,"The alien. It's slowing down. Warp five, four, two. It's going"
KIRK,He may be turning to fight.
SULU,"No, sir. They're just dead out there."
KIRK,Are you sure?
SULU,"Yes, sir. Unmoving."
KIRK,Then we've got them. Go to Red Alert. Prepare to fire phaser
SPOCK,"Computer lock ready, Captain. All systems standing by."
SULU,Range is one eight one zero. One seven six zero. Range is one
SULU,"Warp six, warp five, four, warp three, warp one. Sublight,"
KIRK,From warp eight? Have you lost your mind?
SPOCK,"Same as the alien, Captain."
KIRK,"Mister Scott, report."
SCOTT,"We're dead, Captain. Locked up. Frozen tight. All propulsion"
SCOTT,"They're all normal, sir. Atmosphere, heat, light. No variance."
KIRK,Phaser banks. Report.
KIRK,"Damage Control, report."
SPOCK,"All systems report normal, Captain. No ascertainable damage."
SCOTT,"I don't know, sir, but whatever it is, we canna move."
SPOCK,"We're being held in place, Captain, apparently from that solar"
SPOCK,We are being held.
KIRK,Tractor beam?
SPOCK,"No, sir. An unidentifiable power."
KIRK,This is Kirk.
KIRK,I don't understand.
KIRK,What makes you think you can interfere with
KIRK,Just a minute
SULU,He's gone.
SPOCK,Have you tried overload?
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. It does no good."
SPOCK,How about bypassing the transformer banks? Feed the impulse
SCOTT,"I tried that, sir. Nothing."
SPOCK,"Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature"
UHURA,"No, sir. They report they definitely emanate from that solar"
SPOCK,No indication of its composition? Gravimetric? Magnetic?
UHURA,"Nothing, sir."
KIRK,This is Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. Who ever
KIRK,"The Metrons, the creatures that sent us both here, said that the"
SPOCK,"Leave channel one open, Lieutenant, just in"
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
MCCOY,"What are you going to do, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"I'm going to wait, Doctor. There's little else I can do."
MCCOY,What about the Captain?
SPOCK,"If I could help him, I would. I cannot."
MCCOY,"Now, you're the one that's always talking about logic. What"
SPOCK,"He's out there, Doctor. Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic"
KIRK,A large deposit of diamonds on the surface. Perhaps the hardest
SPOCK,This is the U. S. S. Enterprise calling the

MCCOY,"The ship, our engines, our weapons. It's"
SPOCK,"But it has happened, Doctor."
MCCOY,We appeal to you in the name of civilisation. Put a stop to this.
MCCOY,If there were only some way we could contact him.
SPOCK,"Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were. Notice the substance"
MCCOY,So?
SPOCK,"Perhaps nothing, Doctor. (Kirk tastes the mineral and spits it"
MCCOY,Can that be true? Was Cestus Three an intrusion on their space?
SPOCK,"It may well be possible, Doctor. We know very little about that"
MCCOY,Then we could be in the wrong.
SPOCK,Perhaps. That is something best decided by diplomats.
MCCOY,The Gorn simply might have been trying to protect themselves.
SPOCK,Yes.
SPOCK,Fascinating. Good. Good. (Kirk cuts vines to length against a
SPOCK,Yes. Yes.
MCCOY,"What is it, Spock?"
MCCOY,What's he doing?
MCCOY,What force?
SPOCK,"Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor. Gunpowder."
MCCOY,Can he do it?
SPOCK,"If he has the time, Doctor. If he has the time."
KIRK,"No. No, I won't kill you. Maybe you thought you were protecting"
KIRK,"No, I won't kill him! Do you hear? You'll have to get your"
KIRK,You're a Metron?
METRON,"Does my appearance surprise you, Captain?"
KIRK,You seem more like a boy.
METRON,I am approximately fifteen hundred of your Earth years old. You
KIRK,How?
METRON,By sparing your helpless enemy who surely would have destroyed
KIRK,What happened to the Gorn?
GORN,"I sent him back to his ship. If you like, I shall destroy him for"
KIRK,No. That won't be necessary. We can talk. Maybe reach an

KIRK,Mister Sulu.
SULU,"It's impossible, but there's Sirius over there when it should be"
I meanKIRK,"Don't try and figure it out, Mister Sulu. Just plot a course for"
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
SPOCK,"After you touched off your primitive cannon, Captain, we lost"
SPOCK,Most of it. I would be interested in knowing what finally
KIRK,"We're a most promising species, Mister Spock, as predators go."
SPOCK,I've frequently had my doubts.
KIRK,"I don't. Not anymore. And maybe in a thousand years or so, we'll"
SULU,Warp factor one.
SPOCK,"A thousand years, Captain?"
Original Airdate,"26 Jan, 1967"
WEBB, Captain.
CAPTAIN,"What is it, Webb?"
WEBB,"A blip, sir. Just came on the screen."
CAPTAIN,How do you read it?
WEBB,"Aircraft of some sort. By the size of it and the speed, it's not"
CAPTAIN,What was the approach?
WEBB,"None, sir. It was just there, like it fell out of the sky or"
CAPTAIN, Current position?
WEBB,"Directly over the Omaha installation, sir. Holding there."
CAPTAIN,"Watch the scope, Webb. Air Defence will want to send somebody"
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,"Except for secondary systems, everything is out, sir. We're on"
KIRK,Auxiliaries?
SPOCK,"If Mister Scott is still with us, auxiliaries should be on"
SPOCK,Mister Scott is still with us.
KIRK,"This is the Captain. Damage control parties on all decks, check"
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,Captain? Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries.
KIRK,Orbit where?
SPOCK,"Earth, Captain. We were on a general course in this direction"
KIRK,Screen on.
SPOCK,"We are too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit, Captain."
KIRK,"Give us some altitude, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Yes, sir. Helm answering. She's sluggish, sir."
UHURA,"Captain, normal Starfleet channel has nothing but static. I'm"
KIRK,Put it on audio.
KIRK,Manned Moon shot? That was in the late 1960s.
SPOCK,"Apparently, Captain, so are we."
KIRK,What?
SPOCK,"Whiplash propelled us into a time warp, Captain. Backward. Exact"
UHURA,"Captain, I'm getting ground to air transmission."
SPOCK,Verified. Scanners report some type of craft approaching from
CHRISTOPHER,I have him on my screen. Following.
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, can you gain altitude faster? I"
SULU,"Picking up, sir, but she's still slow in responding."
CHRISTOPHER,"Blackjack, this is Bluejay 4. UFO is"
CHRISTOPHER,"I can see it now. Whatever this is, it's big. Two"
CHRISTOPHER,I won't be here. The UFO's climbing away fast.
SPOCK,"Positive identification, Captain. Aircraft is an interceptor,"
KIRK,"Scotty, activate tractor beam. Lock onto that aircraft and hold"
SPOCK,"Captain, this type of aircraft might be too fragile to take our"
SPOCK,"Aircraft is breaking up, Captain."
KYLE,"Scanning area, sir."
KIRK,"Try and beam that pilot aboard. Take over, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
CHRISTOPHER,You speak English.
KIRK,That's right. You can step off the transporter

KIRK,"Relax, Captain, you're among friends. I'm Captain James T. Kirk."
CHRISTOPHER,What's going on here? Where am I? What happened? You

CHRISTOPHER,Don't give me any double-talk. Just tell me who you are.

KIRK,Affirmative. We have the pilot aboard. I'll be right up. Kirk

KIRK,Morning.  Captain.
CHRISTOPHER,A woman?
KIRK,Crewman.
KIRK,Bridge.

KIRK,There are only twelve like it in the fleet.
CHRISTOPHER,I see. Did the Navy

CHRISTOPHER,United Earth?
KIRK,This is very difficult to explain. We're from your future. A time

SPOCK,Captain.

CHRISTOPHER,"Interesting is a word and a half for it, Captain."
SPOCK,We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere. Our
KIRK,"Very well, Mister Spock. Anything else on your mind?"
SPOCK,Captain Christopher.
KIRK,What about him?
SPOCK,"We cannot return him to Earth, Captain. He already knows too"
KIRK,Your logic can be most annoying.
KIRK,That flight suit must be uncomfortable.  Why don't you
SPOCK,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Computer on. Record.
COMPUTER, Recording.
KIRK,Come.
KIRK,"Captain's log, supplemental. Engineering Officer Scott informs"
COMPUTER,"Computed and recorded, dear."
KIRK,"Computer, you will not address me in that manner. Compute."
COMPUTER,"Computed, dear."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking"
SPOCK,"I have investigated it, Captain. To correct the fault will"
KIRK,I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so affectionate.
SPOCK,It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle.
CHRISTOPHER,I take it that a lady computer is not routine.
SPOCK,We put in at Cygnet Fourteen for general repair and maintenance.
CHRISTOPHER,"Well, you people certainly have interesting problems. I'd"
but KIRK,I'm afraid you'll have to. We can't send you back.
CHRISTOPHER,Can't? Spock here told me that your transporter can beam
KIRK,It's not the transporter. It's you. You know what the future
CHRISTOPHER,"Well then my disappearance would change something, too."
SPOCK,I have run a computer check on all historical tapes. They show
CHRISTOPHER,"Look, Captain, I don't buy all your time accident story."
KIRK,"I'd report, If I could. We can't take the risk."
CHRISTOPHER,"I don't want to know about risks. I have a wife, two"
KIRK,I'm sorry.
KIRK,Kirk here.
SCOTT,"Progress report, sir. Everything's jury-rigged, but we're coming"
KIRK,"But what, Scotty?"
SCOTT,"Well sir, as I say, the engines are being"
KIRK,"Yes, Scotty. Carry on."

MCCOY,"Well, Jim, with the exception of a slight"
KIRK,"He tried to escape. I know how he feels, but I can't send him"
MCCOY,"Jim, what if we can't go back? What do we do, sit up here and"
KIRK,Yes. But we're not in that position yet.
MCCOY,I'm glad to hear it.
KIRK,"And if we do get back to where we belong, then he won't belong."
MCCOY,"Maybe he could be retrained, reeducated."
KIRK,Now you're sounding like Spock.
MCCOY,"If you're going to get nasty, I'm going to leave."
KIRK,Could he be retrained to forget his family? His children?
CHRISTOPHER,The answer to that is no.
KIRK,You all right?
CHRISTOPHER,"Yeah. I see physical training is required in your service,"
SPOCK,"Crude methods, but effective."
CHRISTOPHER,What does he mean by that?
MCCOY,"It's just a joke, Captain."
KIRK,"You said you had some additional information, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,I made an error in my computations.
MCCOY,Oh? This could be an historic occasion.
SPOCK,I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after
CHRISTOPHER,Why? You said I made no relative contribution.
SPOCK,"Poor choice of words on my part. I neglected, in my initial"
which is a rather significant CHRISTOPHER,Wait a minute. I don't have a son.
MCCOY,You mean yet.
SPOCK,The doctor is correct. Unless we return Captain Christopher to
KIRK,"Well, that's it, isn't it? We'll have to find some way of"
CHRISTOPHER,A boy. I'm going to have a son.
SPOCK,Acknowledging that we must return Captain
KIRK,That means those search parties will be crawling all over that
SPOCK,And Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter.
CHRISTOPHER,"When I made visual contact, I turned on my wing cameras. I"
KIRK,"If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as"
SPOCK,"Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane."
KIRK,"What about our problem, Mister Spock? Any ideas on how to get us"
SPOCK,A theory. A reverse application of what happened to us.
KIRK,We're going to have to go back and get those reports and photos.
CHRISTOPHER,That makes me out to be either a liar or a fool.
KIRK,Perhaps.
SPOCK,Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he

d like to KIRK,"No, Captain. Thank you, but if anything should go wrong, you"
CHRISTOPHER,"Well, I'd like to help. I could sketch a layout of the"
KIRK,Primitive computer. I've seen them demonstrated in museums.
SULU,"Me, too. If this one's like those, it'll make the devil's noise"
KIRK,I don't intend to start it.
MCCOY,How long have they been down there now?
SPOCK,"Fifteen minutes, twenty eight seconds."
MCCOY,"Well, shouldn't they be coming up?"
SPOCK,"It is a fact, Doctor, that prowling by stealth is more"
In our case MCCOY,"Shouldn't you be working on your time warp calculations, Mister"
SPOCK,I am.
SERGEANT,"Hold it. Get your hands up. Now, one at a time, hand me those"
SERGEANT,And the bag.
MCCOY,It's been too long. Jim should have at least
SPOCK,"You may be correct, Doctor. Open communicator channel."
SERGEANT,What was that?
KIRK,What was what?
SERGEANT,That noise.
SULU,I didn't hear anything.
SERGEANT,That noise. It's coming from one of these things.
SULU,The emergency signal.
SERGEANT,Stay right where you are.
KYLE,"One emergency signal, sir."
SPOCK,Beam up immediately.
MCCOY,Only one signal. What happened?
SPOCK,"We'll know in a moment, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Spock here. Are you all right, Captain?"
KIRK,"Yes, I'm all right, but as you can see, we"
KIRK,Your surprise package is an Air Police
SPOCK,"I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain."
SPOCK,Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is.
KIRK,Kirk out. 
SULU,"Five thirty in that time zone, maybe a little after."
KIRK,"Put it at the end of these tapes, will you? Get them all."
KIRK,We'll try the darkroom.
FELLINI,Photo lab.
KIRK,"Yes, that's it. That's all of them. Signal Mister Spock that"
SULU,"Yes, sir."
FELLINI,All right. Where's the other one?
KIRK,What other one?
FELLINI,Your partner. I saw you looking that was and I saw somebody
KIRK,"No, no, no. Just me. Besides, could anyone get out of here"
FELLINI,No. Nobody should have been able to.
SPOCK,"Your decision to beam up was quite correct,"
SPOCK,Spock here.
SPOCK,"Do so now, engineer. We'll need all power to test our theory."
SPOCK, Poor photography.
MCCOY,"Blast your theories and observations, Mister Spock. What about"
SPOCK,"I am aware of that, Doctor. This is the first officer. Captain"
FELLINI,"Now, look, Mister. You and I had better"
KIRK,"Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me."
FELLINI,Don't try to be funny. How did you get in?
KIRK,I popped in out of thin air.
FELLINI,You seem to think this is some kind of a game.
KIRK,"No, Colonel. I know it's no game."
FELLINI,All right. What did you say your name was?
KIRK,"For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk."
FELLINI,"And how did you get inside a top security installation, James"
KIRK,"I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
KIRK,"Colonel, would you mind being careful with that?"
FELLINI,"That worries you a little bit, huh? What is that, a radio?"
KIRK,Of some kind.
FELLINI,"You can be more specific than that, Kirk. I don't like"
KIRK,"If you don't stop being careless with that, you'll have one. A"
FELLINI,"I'll have it disassembled and examined. We are not dummies,"
KIRK,This little thing? Just something I slipped on.
FELLINI,"Kirk, maybe you don't realise how serious this is. Sabotage of"
a government installation KIRK,Did I sabotage something?
FELLINI,No. We stopped you in time. But what would you have done if we
KIRK,"Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all."
FELLINI,Is that what you're here for? Nothing at all?
KIRK,That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered.
FELLINI,"All right, Kirk. Maybe this will make you laugh. Sabotage,"
KIRK,"All right, Colonel. The truth is, I'm a little green man from"
FELLINI,I am going to lock you up for two hundred years.
KIRK,That ought to be just about right.
CHRISTOPHER,He's probably being held in security
SPOCK,"Quite logical, Captain. Can you give us the co-ordinates to beam"
CHRISTOPHER,"Yes, but you're not going to get them unless you take me"
SPOCK,"I can't do that, Captain."
MCCOY,If something went wrong
CHRISTOPHER,"Something's already gone wrong. Of course, you could beam"
SPOCK,"Mister Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me."
SULU,Shall I issue phasers?
SPOCK,"One for you, one for me. Set them on heavy stun force."
SULU,"Yes, sir. "
CHRISTOPHER,"You don't trust me, Spock."
SPOCK,"In fact, I do. But only to a certain point."
SPOCK,Energise.
SERGEANT,Do they do that all the time?
KYLE,Are you hungry?
SERGEANT,Uh-huh.
KYLE,What would you like?
SERGEANT,Maybe some chicken soup.
SERGEANT,It is.
GUARD,"Just a minute, sir. Hold it."
FELLINI,"See what that is, airman."
SPOCK,"Don't you find that painful, Captain?"
KIRK,"Yes, I do. What's he doing here?"
SPOCK,He knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the
KIRK,"I see. No harm done. Mister Sulu, did you check out those tapes?"
SULU,Mister Spock ran them through. They were the right ones. We got
CHRISTOPHER,They know you've been here.
KIRK,"All they have is a mystery and no answers. Mister Sulu, signal"
SULU,"Yes, sir."
CHRISTOPHER, Uh-uh. Not me.
KIRK,Don't be a fool. You know what's at stake.
CHRISTOPHER,You bet I do. My family. A son that isn't born yet. You
KIRK,You can't explain your presence on the base.
CHRISTOPHER,I told you it's my duty to report everything I've seen.
KIRK,"You'll go home, Christopher but you'll do it our way."
CHRISTOPHER,Over my dead body.
SPOCK,I suspected he might not wish to return with us.
KIRK,"Four to beam up, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,Mister Scott and I both agree that the only

SPOCK,"Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll"

KIRK,"Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance. Especially if one"
KIRK,"Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Warp factor three, sir."
CHRISTOPHER,I never thought I'd make it into space. I was in line to
KIRK,"Take a good look around, Captain. You made it here ahead of all"
SULU,"Sir, our speed is increasing. We're travelling at over warp"
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,"Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased"
KIRK,Get your gear. Report to the transporter room. And Captain
SPOCK,"Approaching breakaway point. On the countdown. Ten, nine, eight,"
KIRK,"Now, Mister Sulu.  More power, Mister"
SULU,"It's maximum now, sir. She's fighting it."
SPOCK,We've broken free and heading back.
SULU,"Gaining speed now, Captain. We're now at warp four, warp seven."
SPOCK,"Chronometers moving forward again, Captain."
KIRK,Do you have the chronometer reading and the co-ordinates to
SPOCK,Computed.
KIRK,Bridge to transporter room. Captain Christopher.
CHRISTOPHER,This is Christopher.
KIRK,"We're coming up on Earth fast, Captain. Are"
CHRISTOPHER,"Captain, thanks for the look ahead."
KIRK,"Our pleasure, Captain. Bridge out."
SPOCK,"Twenty minutes, sir. It'll be close."
KIRK,Bridge to transporter room. Prepare to energise.
SPOCK,"Ten minutes. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two,"
KIRK,Energise.
FLIGHT,You should be close enough for a visual
FLIGHT,Bluejay Four. Can you see it? What is it? Bluejay 4. Come in.
CHRISTOPHER,"Blackjack, this is Bluejay Four. I could have sworn there"
FLIGHT,We don't track mirages.
SPOCK,"Approaching second beaming, Captain."
KIRK,"Bridge to transporter room, prepare to energise."
SPOCK,Now.
KIRK,Energise.
SULU,"Past Pluto, sir."
KIRK,"What's our reading, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Approaching our century, Captain. Braking should begin now."
KIRK,Bridge to engineering. Begin full braking power.
SCOTT,"Pulling away from the sun weakened them,"
KIRK,"No choice, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,Fifty years to go.
SULU,"Engines cutting back, sir. No decrease in speed."
SPOCK,"Forty, thirty."
KIRK,"Never mind, Mister Spock."
SULU,The engines!
SCOTT,Engine room to Bridge. Engines are on full

MCCOY,Jim.
KIRK,Go on. I'm waiting to hear the rest.

STONE,"Then why, Captain, does the computer log from your ship, made"
KIRK,I don't know. There's been a mistake.

KIRK,Is that the way you see it?
STONE,That's the way my report'll read if you co-operate.
KIRK,A physical breakdown. Possibly even mental collapse.

SHAW,"And so must the Enterprise. Goodbye, Jim."
KIRK,"Goodbye, Areel. Better luck next time."
SHAW,"I had pretty good luck this time. I lost, didn't l?"
KIRK,She's a very good lawyer.
SPOCK,Obviously.
MCCOY,Indeed she is.

SULU,"O'Neil, we've got to keep going. Come on, get up."
NEIL,It's no use. They're everywhere.
SULU,The Captain gave us an order. We've got to find some clue.
NEIL,"It's no use, Mister Sulu. Look, there's one of them. There's"
SULU,Scouting party to Enterprise.
KIRK,"What is it, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,"Captain, beam us up quick. Emergency."
KIRK,"Transporter room, lock onto Sulu and O'Neil."
NEIL,We've got to make a run for it. We can't
SULU,"Mister O'Neil, stand tight. They'll beam us up any minute."
NEIL,"Run, I tell you. We've got to get out of here. You know what"
SULU,O'Neil!
KIRK,"Sulu, what is it? Where's Lieutenant O'Neil?"
SULU,What? Who?
KIRK,Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he?
SULU,You. You're not of the Body.
KIRK,Doctor McCoy.
SCOTT,"Doctor McCoy, transporter room. Quickly."
SULU,"You, you did it. They knew we were Archons. These are the clothes"
KIRK,"Sulu, take it easy."
SULU,Landru. Landru.
KIRK,Sit down.  What happened?
SULU,"They're wonderful. They're the sweetest, friendliest people in"
KIRK,Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he?
SULU,Paradise. Paradise.
KIRK,Materialisation completed. Kirk out.
SPOCK,Odd. The expression on that man's face. The mindlessness. Vacant
KIRK,Like Sulu. If everybody on this planet is like him. Let's go.
BILAR,"Joy to you, friends."
KIRK,Joy to you.
BILAR,"You be strangers. Come for the Festival, are ya?"
KIRK,Yes.
BILAR,Got a place to sleep it off yet? Go round to Reger's house. He's
KIRK,"This Festival, it starts at six o'clock?"
BILAR,"Tula, these folks come for the Festival. Your daddy can put them"
TULA,You're from the Valley?
LINDSTROM,We've just arrived.
TULA,"My father will be glad to put you up, though. It's right over"
BILAR,"Tula, come!"
KIRK,Let's get out of here.
TAMAR,Welcome? You are strangers?
KIRK,"Yes, that's right. We're from the valley."
HACOM,You came for the Festival?
KIRK,Yes.
HACOM,Then how come you here?
LINDSTROM,Are you Reger?
REGER,Yes.
LINDSTROM,You have a daughter named Tula.
REGER,Yes.
LINDSTROM,"Well, you'd better do something. She's outside."
REGER,I know. It's Festival. It's the will of Landru.
HACOM,"Reger, these are young men. They are not old enough to be"
REGER,They're visitors.
HACOM,"Well, have they no Lawgivers in the Valley? Why be they not at"
KIRK,We heard that you might have rooms for us.
REGER,"There. You see, Hacom? They've merely come looking for a place"
HACOM,The Red Hour has already struck.
TAMAR,"Hacom, these be strangers. The Valley has different ways."
HACOM,Do you say that Landru is not everywhere?
TAMAR,"No, of course not. It's simply they may have different ways."
REGER,"They've come looking for shelter. Can I turn them away? Come,"
LINDSTROM,"But the girl, out there."
HACOM,"She is in festival, as you should be."
REGER,"Come, please. Hurry."
HACOM,The Lawgivers should know.
TAMAR,"Surely, Hacom, they already know. Are they not infallible?"
HACOM,You mock them! You mock the Lawgivers. And the strangers are not
TAMAR,"But, Hacom"
REGER,You can return here at the close of the Festival. It's quiet.
KIRK,"We have no plans to attend the Festival, sir."
REGER,The hour is struck. You can hear.
KIRK,"I'd like to hear more about this Festival, and Landru."
REGER, Landru? You ask? You're strange. You scorn Festival?
KIRK,What about Landru?
RIOTER,Festival! Festival!
KIRK,Landru. My guess is we have until morning. Let's put the time to
KIRK,"Spock. Spock, Lindstrom. Doc."
REGER,"No, no it's all over now. It's all over now,"
MCCOY,Excuse me.
REGER,It's all right. It's all over.
KIRK,He'll give her a shot. It'll calm her down. Trust us.
LINDSTROM,You didn't even try to bring her back. What kind of father
REGER,It's Landru's will.
KIRK,What about Landru? Who is he?
TAMAR,It is true then. You did not attend the Festival last night.
KIRK,No.
REGER,Then you're not of the Body. You couldn't be.
MCCOY,She's asleep.
REGER,"Are you, are you Archons?"
KIRK,What if we are?
REGER,It was said more would follow. If you are indeed
TAMAR,We must hide them. Quickly. The Lawgivers.
KIRK,We can take care of ourselves.
TAMAR,Landru will know. He will come.
HACOM,He is the one. He mocked the Lawgivers. I heard him.
TAMAR,"No, Hacom. It was a jest."
HACOM,"The others, they were here, but they scorned the Festival. I saw"
LAWGIVER,"Tamar, stand clear."
TAMAR,I hear and obey the voice of Landru.
LAWGIVER,You attacked the Body. You have heard the Word and disobeyed.
KIRK,"What do you mean, absorbed?"
HACOM,"There, you see? Not of the body."
LAWGIVER,You will be absorbed. The Good is all. Landru is gentle. You
KIRK,We're not going anywhere.
LAWGIVER,It is the law. You must come.
KIRK,I said we're not going anywhere.
SPOCK,Evidently they're not prepared to deal with out right
KIRK,Everything we've seen here so far seems to indicate some sort of
SPOCK,Your analysis seems logical.
LAWGIVER,It is clear that you simply did not understand. I will
KIRK,Why did you kill that man?
LAWGIVER,Out of order. You will obey. It is the word of Landru.
KIRK,You tell Landru that we'll come in our own time and that we'll
LAWGIVER,You cannot. It is Landru.
HACOM,Landru.
SPOCK,"Fascinating. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain. No"
REGER,They're communing. We have time. Come with me.
KIRK,Where to?
REGER,"To a place I know. You'll be safe there, but we must hurry."
KIRK,Quite a festival they had.
REGER,Peace.
KIRK,What do you make of all this?
SPOCK,"Totally illogical. Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason,"
now KIRK,Now they're back to normal.
BILAR,"Morning, friends."
ALL,"Good morning, Bilar."
LINDSTROM,Your daughter. That's the man.
REGER,"No, it wasn't Bilar. It was Landru. Let's hurry, we haven't much"
REGER,It's too late. Look.
KIRK,What is it?
REGER,Landru. He's summoning the body.
SPOCK,"Telepathy, Captain."
KIRK,"Phasers on stun. Which way, Reger?"
REGER,"Perhaps through there, but Landru"
KIRK,"We'll handle Landru, Just get us out of this."
KIRK,I don't want to hurt them. Warn them back.
REGER,They're in the Body. It's Landru.
KIRK,"Phasers on stun, wide field. Fire."
KIRK,Fire.
KIRK,Security.
MCCOY,Captain.
KIRK,Lieutenant O'Neil. He's one of our men.
REGER,Not anymore. He's been absorbed.
KIRK,Bring him along.
REGER,"The Lieutenant is one of them. When he wakes, Landru will find"
LINDSTROM,"Captain, now that we've got Lieutenant O'Neil, let's beam up"
KIRK,We still don't know what's happened to the Archons. Which way?
MCCOY,Put him over there.
KIRK,A lighting panel.
SPOCK,Amazing in this culture.
REGER,Comes from a time before Landru.
KIRK,Before Landru? How long ago was that?
REGER,Nobody knows positively. Some say as long ago as six thousand
SPOCK,It took a very advanced technology to construct a device like
Inconsistent with this environment KIRK,But not inconsistent with what we've seen. Security.
KIRK,Those staffs. Hollow tubes. Antennae for some sort of broadcast
SPOCK,"Strong power generations, Captain. Near here, but radiating in"
MCCOY,"He'll be coming around soon, Captain."
REGER,He must not. He's been absorbed.
KIRK,Absorbed?
REGER,The Body absorbs its enemies. It only kills when it has to. When
And if theothers come KIRK,What others?
REGER,"Those like you and me, who resist Landru."
SPOCK,An underground? How are you organised?
REGER,"In threes. Myself, Tamar, who's dead now, and one other."
KIRK,Who?
REGER,I don't know. Tamar was my contact.
MCCOY,"Give me a decision, Captain. He's coming out of it."
REGER,He must not regain consciousness. He'll destroy us all. He's of
KIRK,"Give him a shot. Keep him asleep. Reger, I want some answers."
REGER,"I don't know, Captain. Some of us escape the directives. Not"
KIRK,The Archons. Tell me about them.
REGER,"They had invaded the Body, but they resisted the will of Landru."
KIRK,"Pulled them down from the skies? A starship? Mister Spock, those"
SPOCK,Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative.
KIRK,"Kirk to Enterprise, come in."
SCOTT,"Captain, we're under attack. There are heat"
SCOTT,"Our shields are holding, but they're taking all our power."
KIRK,Orbit condition.
SCOTT,"Checking. We're going down, Captain. Unless"
KIRK,Keep your shield up. Do everything you can to
SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,What is it?
SPOCK,"Sensor beams, very strong. We're being probed. In this"
REGER,Landru.
SPOCK,Block them out.
SPOCK,"Too strong, Captain. Can't be blocked."
REGER, Oh.
LANDRU,I am Landru.
SPOCK,"Projection, Captain. Unreal."
KIRK,"But beautiful, Mister Spock, with no apparatus at this end."
LANDRU,You have come as destroyers. You bring an infection.
KIRK,You are holding my ship. I demand that you release it.
LANDRU,"You have come to a world without hate, without fear, without"
KIRK,We mean you no harm. Ours is a mission of peace and good will.
LANDRU,The good must transcend the evil. It shall be done. So it has

LINDSTROM, Maybe he'll hear this.
KIRK,"Put that away. Landru, listen to me."
LANDRU,You will be absorbed. Your individuality will merge into the
REGER,Oh.
KIRK,Mister Spock. Wake up. Mister Lesley.
SPOCK,Where's Doctor McCoy?
KIRK,"He was gone when I woke up, along with the other guard and Mister"
SPOCK,I should say they've been here and been removed.
KIRK,Where is here?
SPOCK,Evidently a maximum security establishment. Are you armed?
KIRK,No. All our phasers are gone. I checked. That's locked.
LINDSTROM,"Oh, does my head ache."
SPOCK,The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic.
LINDSTROM,"Oh, is that what it was?"
SPOCK,"Sound waves. Stronger, they might have killed us. As it was,"
KIRK,Enough analysis. Let's think of a way to get out of here. What
SPOCK,"We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain. In a"
KIRK,"Are you suggesting the Lawgivers are mere computers, that they"
SPOCK,"Quite human, Captain. It's simply that all the facts are not yet"
KIRK,Doc. How?
MCCOY,"Hello, friend. We were told to wait here."
KIRK,Doc!
MCCOY,"Can I help you, friend?"
KIRK,Don't you know me?
MCCOY,We all know one another and Landru.
SPOCK,Like Sulu.
KIRK,"Think, man. The Enterprise. The ship. Remember?"
MCCOY,"You speak very strangely, friend. Are you from away?"
KIRK,You do remember!
MCCOY,Ask Landru. He remembers. He knows and he watches. You are
LAWGIVER,Come.
KIRK,No.
LAWGIVER,Then you will die.
SPOCK,"You've been corrected, Captain. You'd better go."
KIRK,All right. Work on Bones. See if you can't
LAWGIVER,Come.
SPOCK,"Doctor McCoy, what will happen to him?"
MCCOY,"He goes to joy, peace, and tranquillity. He goes to meet Landru."
MARPLON,I am Marplon. It is your hour. Happy communing.
LAWGIVER,With thanks. Happy communing.
LINDSTROM,Well?
SPOCK,Impossible. He's under extremely powerful control.
LINDSTROM,Are we just going to stand here?
SPOCK,"Little else we can do, unless you can think of a way to get"
LINDSTROM,"Well, this is simply ridiculous. A bunch of stone age"
SPOCK,And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension.
LAWGIVER,You. Come.
KIRK,"Joy to you, friend. Peace and contentment will fill you. You will"
MARPLON,"Have no fear, friend. The effect is harmless. My name is"
SPOCK,What about the Captain?
MARPLON,"He is unharmed, unchanged. I am the third man in Reger's"
SPOCK,"We are not Archons, Marplon."
MARPLON,"Whatever you may call yourselves, you are in fulfillment of"
SPOCK,Where is Reger?
MARPLON,He will join us. He is immune to absorption. Hurry. We have
SPOCK,Who is Landru?
MARPLON,"I cannot answer your questions now. Landru, he will hear. Here"
MARPLON,Behave as you saw your Captain behave. It is done.
SPOCK,Joy be with you. Peace and contentment.
SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,Peace and tranquillity to you.  Are you all right?
SPOCK,Quite all right. Be careful of Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,I understand. Landru.
SPOCK,"I am formulating a theory, Captain."
KIRK,And?
SPOCK,Not here. The doctor.
MCCOY,You speak in strange whispers. This is not the way of Landru.
KIRK,"Joy be yours, and tranquillity, my friend."
MCCOY,And peace and harmony. Are you of the Body?
KIRK,The Body is one.
MCCOY,"Blessed be the Body, and health to all of its parts."
KIRK,My friends.  What
SPOCK,"This is a soulless society, Captain. It has no spirit, no spark."
KIRK,"And when something unexplained happens, their routine is"
SPOCK,"Until new orders are received. The question is, who gives those"
KIRK,Landru.
SPOCK,"There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense."
KIRK,"You're thinking the same thing I am. Mister Spock, the plug must"
SPOCK,Sir?
KIRK,Landru must die.
SPOCK,"Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference."
KIRK,"That refers to a living, growing culture. Do you think this one"
MCCOY,"Joy to you all, friends."
MARPLON,It is the gift of Landru.  I've brought

KIRK,Isn't that somewhat old-fashioned? Robes.
KIRK,Where is Landru?
MARPLON,"No, no."
KIRK,Where do we find him?
MARPLON,"We do not see him. We hear him, in the Hall of Audiences."
KIRK,In this building?

KIRK,Put a guard on him.
SCOTT,On Sulu?
KIRK,That's an order. Watch him. Captain out.
SPOCK,Captain. 
REGER,There was war. Convulsions. The world was destroying itself.
KIRK,What happened to him?
MARPLON,He's still alive. He is here now. He sees. He hears. We have

KIRK,It's too late for that.
REGER,No! Lawgivers! Help! Help me!
KIRK,"All right, it's up to you. Take us to Landru."
MARPLON,This is the Hall of Audiences.
KIRK,Open it.
MARPLON,But this is Landru.
KIRK,Open it.
MARPLON,Landru speaks here.
KIRK,Landru! Landru. We are the Archons. We are the Archons. We've

KIRK,Of course. It had to be. Landru.
SPOCK,A machine. This whole society is a machine's concept of

LANDRU,Your statement is irrelevant. You will be obliterated. The good

KIRK,Yes. What is the good?

LANDRU,The good is the harmonious continuation of the Body. The good

SPOCK,Irritation?
KIRK,Yeah.

KIRK,And now
KHAN,Khan is my name.
KIRK,Khan. Nothing else?
KHAN,Khan.

SPOCK,"There is that possibility, Captain. His age would be correct. In"

SPOCK,Because the scientists overlooked one fact. Superior ability

MARLA,I don't understand.
KHAN,A beautiful woman. My name is Khan. Please sit and entertain me.
MARLA,"I'd like some historical information about your ship, its"
purpose and KHAN,And why do you wear your hair in such an uncomplimentary fashion?
MARLA,It's comfortable.
KHAN,But it's not attractive. (He takes her to a mirror and loosens a

MCCOY,Very impressive. Are we expecting a fleet admiral for dinner?
KIRK,Lieutenant McGivers' idea to welcome Khan to our century. Just
MCCOY,"Well, there aren't any regulations against romance, Jim."
KIRK,"My curiosity's official, not personal, Bones."
MCCOY,"Well, he has a magnetism. Almost electric. You felt it. And it"

SPOCK,"Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip?"

KHAN,It has been said that social occasions are only warfare
KIRK,You fled. Why? Were you afraid?
KHAN,I've never been afraid.
KIRK,But you left at the very time mankind needed courage.
KHAN,We offered the world order!
KIRK,We?
KHAN,"Excellent. Excellent. But if you will excuse me, gentlemen and"
MARLA,I wanted to apologise. They had no right to treat you that way.
KHAN,"Quite understandable, since I'm something of a mystery to them."
MARLA,You're no mystery to me. I know exactly who you are.
KHAN,Do you?
MARLA,"Leif Ericson, Richard the Lion Heart, Napoleon. I don't know if"
KHAN,Then I'll have to remold it to my liking.
MARLA,Please don't.
KHAN,Go. Or stay. But do it because it is what you wish to do. Well?
MARLA,I'll stay a little longer.
KHAN,How many minutes do you graciously offer?
MARLA,I only meant
KHAN,This grows tiresome. You must now ask to stay.
MARLA,I'd like to stay. Please.
KHAN,Open your heart. Will you open your heart?
MARLA,Yes.
KHAN,I intend to take this ship. Do you agree?
MARLA,"Oh, please don't ask me"
KHAN,I need your help.
MARLA,You won't harm anyone?
KHAN,Now you question me?
MARLA,No.
KHAN,Will you assist me?
MARLA,"Oh, please, Khan, don't ask me"
KHAN,"Leave me then. Go, I say."
MARLA,No. I promise. I'll do anything you ask.

KIRK,"Mister Spock, we humans have a streak of barbarism in us."
SCOTT,There were no massacres under his rule.
SPOCK,And as little freedom.
MCCOY,No wars until he was attacked.
SPOCK,Gentlemen.
KIRK,"Mister Spock, you misunderstand us. We can be against him and"
SPOCK,Illogical.
KIRK,Totally. This is the Captain. Put a twenty four hour security on

KIRK,Atmospheric controls cut off.
SPOCK,Useless. They're on override in Engineering.
KIRK,Engineering. Scotty. This is the Bridge.
SCOTT,Captain!
KIRK,What's going on down there?
KHAN,"He's not able to answer you at the moment,"
KIRK,Flood all decks with neural gas.
SPOCK,Impossible. Intruder control systems inoperative. Mister Khan
KIRK,Contact Starbase Twelve.
UHURA,"All channels are totally jammed, Captain."
SPOCK,Brilliant. Every contingency anticipated.
KHAN,Do you surrender the Bridge?
KIRK,Negative.
KHAN,"Academic, Captain. Refuse,"
KHAN,"Nothing ever changes, except man. Your technical accomplishments?"
SCOTT,Where is Captain Kirk?
KHAN,I see now I made one serious error. You are the Communications

KHAN,Each of you in turn will go in there. Die while the others watch.
MARLA,"Khan. There's no reason I must watch this, is there?"
KHAN, But I hoped you would be stronger. 
JOACHIM,We've lost the channel. How do I regain picture?
KHAN,It does not matter. The Captain is dead. Take Mister Spock next.
MARLA,Khan said to watch him very closely. He may decide to

KHAN,"If I understood your manuals, that's an overload in progress."
KHAN,I have five times your strength. You're no match for me.

MCCOY,Jim. Agreed you have the authority

KIRK,Are you sure?
UHURA,Positive. It repeats over and over.
FOX,Is that supposed to mean something?
KIRK,Code seven-ten means under no circumstances are we to approach

SPOCK,We've selected a site which from the traffic seems to be near an

KIRK,The ship is yours. Take care of her until I come back.

MEA,I know. I'm Mea 3. I congratulate you on your instrumentation.
MEA,"Captain, I wish"
KIRK,Yes?
MEA,You were warned not to come here.
KIRK,I had orders to come here. Why did your people tell us to stay
MEA,"It was for your own safety, Captain."
KIRK,I see no danger here.
MEA,"The danger exists. Nevertheless, you are here. It would be morally"
KIRK,"I'm Captain Kirk. This is my first officer, Mister Spock,"
ANAN,"Welcome to Eminiar Seven. Well, Captain, what can we do for you?"
KIRK,My mission is to establish diplomatic relations between your
ANAN,That is impossible.
KIRK,Would you mind telling me why?
ANAN,Because of the war.
KIRK,You're still at war?
ANAN,We have been at war for five hundred years.
KIRK,You conceal it very well. Mister Spock?
SPOCK,"Sir, we have completely scanned your planet. We find it highly"
ANAN,Casualties among our civilian population total from one to three
SPOCK,With whom are you at war?
ANAN,"The third planet in our system, called Vendikar. Originally"
ANAN,"Please excuse me. Vendikar is attacking. Mea, care for our"
SPOCK,Strange.
KIRK,To say the least.
MEA,It will not last long.
KIRK,Don't you take shelter?
MEA,"There is no shelter, Captain."
SPOCK,Are these attacks frequent?
MEA,"Oh yes, and we will retaliate immediately."
MEA,Oh!
KIRK,What is it?
MEA,A hit right here in the city.
KIRK,"Do you hear any explosions, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"None, Captain. Yeoman Tamula."
TAMULA,Sir?
SPOCK,Tricorder readings. Radiation. Disturbances of any kind.
TAMULA,"Working, sir. No evidence."
KIRK,"Mea, if this is an attack, may I ask what weapons the enemy is"
MEA,"Fusion bombs, materialised by the enemy over their targets."
KIRK,Kirk to Bridge. Scotty?
KIRK,Scanners operative on the planet's surface?
KIRK,Anything unusual?
KIRK,Thank you. Kirk out.
SAR,"Look, Anan. "
ANAN,"Yes, I see it. They were warned."
SAR,Just as it happened fifty years ago.
ANAN,Alert a security detachment. They may be needed.

KIRK,You mean to tell me your people just walk into a disintegration

SPOCK,There is a certain scientific logic about it.
ANAN,I'm glad you approve.

KIRK,Is that all it means to you? To report and die?
MEA,"My life is as dear to me as yours is to you, Captain."
KIRK,Then how can you stand
MEA,"Don't you see? If I refuse to report, and others refuse, then"
KIRK,"No, I don't see that at all."
MEA,It's been our way for almost five hundred years. Is there anything
KIRK,Yes. Anan Seven.
MCCOY,"I tell you, we should have heard something"
SCOTT,"Aye, Doctor, that we should, but we haven't, and we cannot raise"
MCCOY,We can't just sit here.
SCOTT,What would you suggest?
MCCOY,"Me? I'm a doctor. If I were an officer of the line, I'd"
SCOTT,Would you have me open fire?
MCCOY,Of course not.
UHURA,"Mister Scott, message coming in from the Captain."
SCOTT,"Scott here, Captain."
KIRK,"Good news, Mister Scott. The Eminians have agreed to the"
SCOTT,Mister Fox'll be glad to hear about that.
KIRK,They've also extended an invitation to all personnel to come
SCOTT,"Er, Captain?"
ANAN,"Yes, Mister Scott?"
ANAN,All personnel. We'll transport up trained Eminians to assume
SCOTT,"Aye, aye, Captain. We'll start forming shore"
MCCOY,I don't know.
SCOTT,"Well, I do. Computer, last message received and recorded from"
COMPUTER,In place.
SCOTT,Run it through analyser. Question. Is it or is it not the

SCOTT,A voice duplicator?
COMPUTER,Ninety eight percent probability.
SCOTT,"Well, they've got them, Doctor, and now they're trying to get"
KIRK,"Are you sure you can do it, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Limited telepathic abilities are inherent in Vulcanians,"
KIRK,Do your best.
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"My pleasure, Captain."
TAMULA,"What do we do now, Captain?"
KIRK,We get our communicators back and try and contact the ship.
SPOCK,I understand.
KIRK,"We'll try to take it easy, but if we're forced to kill"
SPOCK,"An entrance, Captain, but no exit. They go in, but they do not"
KIRK,A disintegration machine.
SPOCK,So I would assume.
KIRK,Mea. What do you think you're doing?
MEA,I'm going
KIRK,You're not going in there.
MEA,But I must.
KIRK,No you're not.
MEA,"Please. All right, don't worry about me."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, that guard. I'll cover you."
SPOCK,"Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder."
KIRK,"All right, you people, clear out of the way."
MEA,What are you doing?
KIRK,Throwing a monkey wrench into the machinery.
MEA,You can't do this.
KIRK,"I've done it.  Come on, let's get"
ANAN,"All security personnel, Federation prisoners have escaped. They"
ANAN,"In ten seconds, open fire. Destroy the star cruiser. Those are"
DEPAUL,All stations reporting. Deflector screens
SCOTT,"Yes, Mister DePaul?"
DEPAUL,Sensor readings just shot off the scale.
SCOTT,"Well, now. They're taking pot shots at us. Holding, Mister"
DEPAUL,"Screens firm, sir. Extremely powerful sonic vibrations."
MCCOY,"Well, I guess that answers our questions, Mister Scott. They're"
SCOTT,"Aye, but what about our Captain and the landing party down there"
MCCOY,We get them out.
SCOTT,"If they're alive, and if we can find them. That's a big planet."
MCCOY,Not too big for the Enterprise to handle if it has to.
SCOTT,"We can't fire full phasers with our screens up, and We can't"
FOX," You'll do no such thing, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,"Mister Fox, we're under attack. They're trying to knock us down."
FOX,You have taken defensive measures.
SCOTT,"Of course, but"
FOX,"There are no buts. Obviously it's a misunderstanding, and one of"
MCCOY,They're holding our Captain.
FOX,We have no proof of that.
SCOTT,I'm responsible for the safety of this ship.
FOX,"And I'm responsible for the success of this mission, and that's"
SCOTT,"But they're the ones who're looking for a fight, Mister Fox."
FOX,"This is a diplomatic matter. If you check your regulations, you'll"
SCOTT,Diplomats. The best diplomat I know is a fully activated phaser
TAMULA,"Why did we come back here, Captain?"
KIRK,The last place they'll look for us is the place we escaped from.
MEA,"Captain, you've got to let me go. My time is almost up."
KIRK,Are you that anxious to die?
MEA,You don't understand.
KIRK,"Mister Spock, how did that little raid work out?"
SPOCK,"We captured four of their disrupter-type weapons, two complete"
KIRK,Will it reach the ship?
SPOCK,Not at this time. Its range is restricted in comparison with

MEA,No!
KIRK,Now listen to me. I'm trying to help you. To save your life and
MEA,What are you going to do?
KIRK,We're going to try and stop the killing. We're trying to help.

ANAN,I'm giving orders that our attack be stopped.
FOX,Thank you. I thought perhaps it was all a mistake.

KIRK,I didn't come to drink.
ANAN,I assume that is what you used to destroy disintegration chamber
KIRK,A very efficient weapon. I'm not afraid of using it.
ANAN,My first impression was correct. You are a barbarian.
KIRK,I am?
ANAN,"Don't sound so incredulous, Captain. Of course you are. We all"
KIRK,We're less cold-blooded about it than you are.
ANAN,"What do you want, Captain?"
KIRK,I want to contact my ship. Where are my communicators?
ANAN,In a safe place.
KIRK,"You take a lot of chances, Councilman."
ANAN,"You're worried about your ship, Captain. I'm trying to save a"
KIRK,"If I were you, I'd think about saving my life."
ANAN,"Won't you have a drink, Captain?"
ANAN,And then we can discuss our differences.
KIRK,I'm not interested in discussing our differences. You don't seem
ANAN,Why do you think I don't let you talk to your ship ?
KIRK,I don't need the ship for that.
ANAN,"You mean, all by yourself with a disruptor, you can destroy this"
KIRK,That's exactly what I mean.
ANAN,I had no idea you were so formidable.
KIRK,You seem to think I'm joking. Where are the communicators?
ANAN,"If I told you, Captain, would you walk right out and get them?"
KIRK,Something like that.
ANAN,"Very well, Captain. They're in the War Room. Go left down the"

SPOCK,The Captain is overdue. We've suffered no casualties among us.

SCOTT,I knew it had a rotten ring to it.
SPOCK,Orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand

TAMULA,"Yes, sir."
FOX,What are you doing? I'm a representative of the United Federation

FOX,Spock!
SPOCK,"Please, Mister Fox. Ladies and gentlemen, please move quickly"
FOX,"What are you doing, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir."

ANAN,It would frighten any sane man.
KIRK,Yes. You're quite right.
ANAN,"Don't you understand, Captain? We have done away with all that."
KIRK,I'm a barbarian. You said it yourself.
ANAN,I had hoped I'd spoken only figuratively.
KIRK,"Oh, no. You were quite accurate. I plan to prove it to you. ANAN:"
KIRK,"Scotty, General Order Twenty Four. Two hours! In two hours!"
ANAN,"Enterprise, this is Anan Seven, First Councilman of the High"
ANAN,Unless you immediately start transportation
KIRK,All that it means is that I won't be around for the destruction.
ANAN,"Planetary defence System, open fire on the Enterprise!"
ANAN,You wouldn't do this. Hundreds of millions of people.

KIRK,"All right, Mister Spock. SPOCK: These are the attack computers,"
KIRK,"Yes, go on."
SPOCK,"At the moment contact is broken, it abrogates the agreement"
SAR,What are you going to do?
SPOCK,"This one's the key. The circuit is now locked. Destroy this one,"
KIRK,Good. Get him out of here.
SAR,"Now wait a minute. Please, please!"
KIRK,Let's go.

ANAN,You realise what you have done?
KIRK,"Yes, I do. I've given you back the horrors of war. The Vendikans"
ANAN,There can be no peace. Don't you see? We've admitted it to
KIRK,All right. It's instinctive. But the instinct can be fought.
FOX,As a third party interested only in peace and the establishment of

ELIAS,How did he feel?
LEILA,Mister Spock's feelings were never expressed to me. It is said
ELIAS,"Would you like him to stay with us now, to be as one of us?"
LEILA,"There is no choice, Elias. He will stay."
MCCOY,That'll be all. Thank you very much.

KIRK,Trouble?
MCCOY,"No, but I'd like you to see this for yourself."

ELIAS,No.

ELIAS,We're vegetarians.
KIRK,"That doesn't answer my question, sir. Why did all your animals"

SPOCK,You've not yet explained the nature of this thing.
LEILA,Its basic properties and elements are not important. What is
SPOCK,What you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a
LEILA,Come. I was one of the first to find them. The spores.
SPOCK,Spores?
SPOCK,No.
LEILA,It shouldn't hurt.
SPOCK,"No, I can't. Please, don't!"
LEILA,Not like this. It didn't hurt us.
SPOCK,I am not like you.
LEILA,"Now. Now, you belong to all of us and we to you. There's no need"
SPOCK,I love you. I can love you.
KIRK,Sandoval.

KIRK,We have orders to evacuate all colonists to Starbase Twenty
SULU,We haven't seen them since we began our check.
MCCOY,DeSalle said he was going to examine some native plants he

SULU,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Spock?
SPOCK,That one looks like a dragon. You see the tail and the dorsal
LEILA,I've never seen a dragon.
SPOCK,I have. On Berengaria Seven. But I've never stopped to look at
LEILA,Not here.
SPOCK,"Yes, what did you want?"
KIRK,"Spock, is that you?"
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain. What did you want?"
SPOCK,I don't believe I want to tell you.
KIRK,"Spock, I don't know what you think you're"
SPOCK,"No, I don't think so."
KIRK,"You don't think so, what?"
SPOCK,"I don't think so, sir."
KIRK,"Spock, report to me immediately."
KIRK,"Spock. The frequency is open, but he doesn't"
MCCOY,"That didn't sound at all like Spock, Jim."
KIRK,No. I thought you said you might like him if he mellowed a
MCCOY,I didn't say that.
KIRK,You said that.
MCCOY,Not exactly. He might be in trouble.
KIRK,"Yes, take over the landing party detail and start getting those"
MCCOY,How will you find Spock?
KIRK,The frequency is open. It'll act as a homing device. Contact
KIRK,Spock.  Mister Spock.
MCCOY,"What are you doing with those things, DeSalle?"
DESALLE,"I want you to take a close look at these, Doc. They're very"
KIRK,Mister Spock. Are you out of your mind? You
SPOCK,"I didn't want to, Jim."
KIRK,"You? Yes, I can see that. Miss Kalomi, you'll have to come back"
SPOCK,"There'll be no evacuation, Jim, but perhaps we should go back"
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, Mister Spock is under arrest, and he's in your"
SPOCK,Very well. Come with me.
KIRK,What's?
SPOCK,"Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,"Yes, I see now. Of course we can't remove the colony. It'd be"
KIRK,"I don't know what these plants are or how they work, but you're"
SPOCK,I can see the Captain is going to be difficult.
MCCOY," Ready to beam up. Hiya, Jimmy"
KIRK,How many of those did you beam up?
MCCOY,"Oh, must be nigh onto a hundred by now."
KIRK,This is the Captain. Beam me up.
KIRK,I most certainly do. Energise.
KIRK,"Lieutenant, put me through to Admiral Komack"
UHURA,"Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. I can't do that."
KIRK,"What do you mean, you can't do that. Follow standard procedure."
UHURA,"Oh, I know it is, Captain, but you see, all communications are"
KIRK,Out?
UHURA,"I short-circuited them, except ship to surface. We'll need that"
KIRK,Get back to your stations. Get back to your stations.
CREWMAN,"I'm sorry, sir. We're all transporting down to join the"
KIRK,I said get back to your station.
CREWMAN,"No, sir."
KIRK,"This is mutiny, mister."
CREWMAN,"Yes, sir. It is."
MCCOY,I'm not interested in any

KIRK,I'll bet you've even grown your tonsils back.
MCCOY,"Sho'nuf. Hey, Jim boy, y'all ever have a"
KIRK,"Look, Bones, I need your help. Can you run"
MCCOY,"Who wants to counteract paradise, Jim boy?"
KIRK,Bones. Bones.
SPOCK,Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down.
ELIAS,I'm very pleased. The entire landing operation is proceeding
KIRK,Where's McCoy?
SPOCK,He went off to create something called a mint julep. That's a
ELIAS,"Captain, why don't you join us?"
KIRK,In your own private paradise.
ELIAS,The spores have made it that.
KIRK,Where did they originate?
SPOCK,It's impossible to say. They drifted through space until they
ELIAS,"In return, they give you complete health and peace of mind."
KIRK,That's paradise?
ELIAS,"We have no need or want, Captain."
SPOCK,"It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love."
KIRK,No wants. No needs. We weren't meant for that. None of us. Man
ELIAS,We have what we need.
KIRK,Except a challenge.
SPOCK,"You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or"
KIRK,I'm going back to the ship.
KIRK,Engineering? Scotty? Biochemistry lab? Security? Is there anyone

KIRK,Enterprise to Mister Spock.
SPOCK,"Yes, Jim. What is it now?"
KIRK,I've joined you. I understand now.
SPOCK,"Wonderful, Jim. When will you beam down?"
KIRK,There are some things in my quarters I want
SPOCK,Good. Leila and I will meet you at the beam
KIRK,No. No! I can't leave!  Emotions. Violent
SPOCK,Spock here.
SPOCK,"What's keeping you, Jim? We've been waiting."
KIRK,"I've been packing some things, and I realise"
SPOCK,Do you want me to beam up a party?
KIRK,"No, I think you and I can handle it. Why"
SPOCK,Just a moment. It won't take long. Do you
LEILA,I'll wait.
SPOCK,"Ready to beam up, Jim."
KIRK,
KIRK,"All right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerised, half-breed,"
SPOCK,"The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is"
KIRK,What makes you think you're a man? You're an overgrown
SPOCK,"Jim, I don't understand."
KIRK,Of course you don't understand. You don't have the brains to

KIRK,"What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose"
SPOCK,My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador.
KIRK,"Your father was a computer, like his son. An ambassador from a"
SPOCK,"Captain, please don't"
KIRK,"You're a traitor from a race of traitors. Disloyal to the core,"
SPOCK,That's enough.
KIRK,"Does she know what she's getting, Spock? A carcass full of memory"
KIRK,Had enough? I didn't realise what it took to get under that thick
SPOCK,You did that to me deliberately.
KIRK,"Believe me, Mister Spock, it was painful in more ways than one."
SPOCK,The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore.
KIRK,You said they were benevolent and peaceful. Violent emotions
SPOCK,"That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl"
KIRK,I had something else in mind. Can you put together a subsonic
SPOCK,It can be done.
KIRK,Good. Let's get to work.
SPOCK,Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence.
KIRK,"Well, if we're both in the Brig, who's going to build the"
SPOCK,"That is quite logical, Captain."
MCCOY,"Well now, it's a little early to be counting"
LEILA,I'm waiting for Mister Spock and the Captain to transport down.
MCCOY,"Well, now, I think I can fix that for you. Enterprise?"
SPOCK,Enterprise. Spock here.
LEILA,This is Leila. I borrowed the doctor's
SPOCK,Yes. Yes. I'm quite well.
LEILA,Can I come aboard? I've never seen a
SPOCK,"Are you still at the beam down point, and is the doctor there?"
LEILA,Yes to both questions.
SPOCK,Give your communicator back to Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,"Mister Spock, Miss Kalomi is strictly your concern, but should"
SPOCK,"I'll be back shortly, Captain."
LEILA,"You're no longer with us, are you? I felt something was wrong."
SPOCK,It was necessary.
LEILA,Come back to the planet with me. You can belong again. Come back
SPOCK,I can't.
LEILA,"I love you. I said that six years ago, and I can't seem to stop"
SPOCK,"I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge."
LEILA,"I have lost you, haven't I? And not only you, I've lost all of"
KIRK,The Captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the
LEILA,And this is for my good? Do you mind if I say I still love you?
SPOCK, You couldn't pronounce it.
SPOCK,"They'll not hear this, of course. It'll be"
KIRK,As though somebody had put itching powder on their skin.
SPOCK,Precisely. It should begin to work on their nerves in a few
SULU,"Sorry, DeSalle."
DESALLE,What do you think you're doing?
SULU,I said I was sorry.
DESALLE,More like you're clumsy.
SULU,If you hadn't gotten in my way
KELOWITZ,Come on. Break it up. Break it up.
ELIAS,"Well, Doctor, I've been thinking about what sort of work I could"
MCCOY,"What do you mean, what sort of work? I'm a doctor."
ELIAS,"Not any more, of course. We don't need you. Not as a doctor."
MCCOY,"Oh, no? Would you like to see how fast I can put you in a"
ELIAS,I am the leader of this colony. I'll assign you whatever work I

MCCOY,You can't stay here. You can't survive without the spores. After

MCCOY,Enterprise.
SPOCK,Enterprise. Spock here.
MCCOY,This is McCoy. Sandoval would like to talk
SPOCK,Just a moment. They're all beginning to call
KIRK,Put him on the speaker. Kirk here.
ELIAS,"Oh, Captain, as I understood it, you were to"
KIRK,"Start making preparations, Mister Sandoval."
MCCOY,"Well, Jim, I've just examined the last of the colonists, and"
KIRK,Good.
MCCOY,"Well, that's the second time man's been thrown out of paradise."
KIRK,"No, no, Bones. This time we walked out on our own. Maybe we"
SPOCK,"Poetry, Captain. Non-regulation."

SPOCK,"I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the"
Original Airdate,"9 Mar, 1967"
SAM,Who's there?
VANDERBERG," It's your relief, Sam. All"
SAM,"Didn't see a thing, Chief."
SCHMITTER,"Nobody ever does. Whatever the thing is, it's already killed"
VANDERBERG,"Stay on your toes, Schmitter. Keep your phaser in your hand"
SCHMITTER,What good will that do? You saw what happened to Ed Appel
VANDERBERG,"I'm sorry, Schmitter. I know how you feel, but we've got to"
SCHMITTER,"Okay, Chief. I'll do what I can."
VANDERBERG,"Keep alert. If you hear anything or see anything, call in."
SCHMITTER,"A lot can happen in three minutes. Chief, is it true the"
VANDERBERG,It's coming.
SCHMITTER,You think it could get here in the next four hours?
VANDERBERG,You'll be all right.
VANDERBERG,Come on.
VANDERBERG,Schmitter. Like the rest of them. Burned to a crisp.
KIRK,"All right, let's assume there is a monster."
VANDERBERG,"About three months ago, we opened up a new level. Sensors"
KIRK,"Yes, we're aware of that. If mining conditions weren't so"
VANDERBERG,"First, the automatic machinery, piece by piece, started to"
SPOCK,I'm sure there is an answer. It simply has not yet been
VANDERBERG,"Yes, it has. I don't know what this butchering monster is,"
KIRK,Volcanic activity?
SPOCK,"There is no current volcanic activity on this planet, Captain."
VANDERBERG,"He's right. None. At first the deaths were down deep, but"
KIRK,Same way? Burned?
MCCOY,I'd like to examine the body.
VANDERBERG,We kept it for you. There isn't much left. Roberts will
KIRK,Do you post sentries? Guards?
VANDERBERG,Of course. Five of them have died.
KIRK,Who else has seen this?
APPEL, I have.
VANDERBERG,"This is Ed Appel, chief processing engineer."
KIRK,Describe it.
APPEL,"I can't. I only got a glimpse of it, but it's big and shaggy."
VANDERBERG,Ed shot it.
SPOCK,Oh. You mean shot at it.
APPEL,No. I mean shot it. With this. 
SPOCK,Fascinating.
APPEL,"A good, clean shot. Didn't even slow it down. Well, I've made my"
KIRK,"That's why we're here, Mister Vanderberg."
APPEL,"You're all pretty tough, aren't you? Starship, phaser banks. You"
KIRK,"I don't think we'll need to, Mister Appel. Mister Vanderberg,"
VANDERBERG,You'll get it.
SPOCK, Mister
VANDERBERG,It's a silicon nodule. There are a millions of them are
SPOCK,"But a geological oddity, to say the least. Pure silicon?"
VANDERBERG,"A few trace elements. Look, we didn't call you here so you"
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Vanderberg. We'll need your complete"
VANDERBERG,"You'll have it. Just find that creature, whatever it is."
KIRK,The vast number of tunnels won't make our hunting any easier.
MCCOY,"Schmitter didn't burn to death, not in the usual sense, anyway."
KIRK,Explain.
MCCOY,"Well, there are only fragments of bone and teeth left, but the"
KIRK,Strong enough to eat machinery?
MCCOY,Strong enough to eat anything else that you can think of.
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK, I've charted the positions of the deaths and
KIRK,"Mister Vanderberg, how recent are these charts?"
VANDERBERG, They were made last year.
KIRK,Before the appearance of whatever it is?
VANDERBERG,That's right.
KIRK,I see. Mister Spock give us a report on life beneath the surface.
KIRK,We can't cover tunnel by tunnel on foot. We must get production
SPOCK,If we could force another appearance of this creature
VANDERBERG,"When that creature appears, men die."
KIRK,"Too many tunnels. We couldn't possibly. Mister Spock, our sensors"
VANDERBERG,Something's happening in the reactor room!
VANDERBERG,Back to your stations. Look at that.
SPOCK,"I wouldn't touch it, Captain. An extremely active corrosive."
VANDERBERG,The main circulating pump for the entire reactor is gone.
SPOCK,"The same indication as shown at the door, Captain. A very strong"
KIRK,Is there a replacement for that?
VANDERBERG,"No, none. It's outdated, but we never had any trouble with"
KIRK,"Spock, on board?"
SPOCK,"Nothing for a device this antiquated, Captain."
VANDERBERG,"Without the pump mechanism, the reactor will go"
KIRK,"Mister Spock, we seem to have been given a choice. Death by"
SCOTT,"A PXK pergium reactor? No, sir. We don't"
KIRK,Can you rig one up? It's vital.
SCOTT,"Well sir, I can put together some odds and"
KIRK,How long?
KIRK,Forty eight hours is better than nothing. Gather what you need
SCOTT,"Aye, Captain."
VANDERBERG,What happens when it breaks down?
KIRK,Hopefully we'll have found the missing part by then.
VANDERBERG,Hopefully. Small chance.
KIRK,"We'll have to, Chief. The alternative is to evacuate all you"
life support systems VANDERBERG,"I'm concerned with my people right here, Kirk. They're"
SPOCK,The missing pump wasn't taken by accident.
KIRK,Do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the
SPOCK,It would seem so.
KIRK,"But why now, Mister Spock? These production facilities have been"
SPOCK,I don't know. But there is a possibility.
KIRK,What's that?
SPOCK,Life as we know it is universally based on some combination of
MCCOY,"You're creating fantasies, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Not necessarily, Bones. I've heard of the theoretical possibility"
SPOCK,"Certainly not phaser one, which is far less powerful than phaser"
KIRK,"All right, how about this? A creature that lives deep in the"
SPOCK,"It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed"
KIRK,But our people have phaser number two.
SPOCK,Which I could adjust to be more effective against silicon.
MCCOY,"Silicon-based life is physiologically impossible, especially in"
SPOCK,"It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods"
MCCOY,I still think you're imagining things.
KIRK,"You may be right, Doctor, but at least it's something to go on."
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain. You recall that Vanderberg commented there were"
KIRK,Do they tie in?
SPOCK,I don't know.
KIRK,Speculate.
SPOCK,I have already given Doctor McCoy sufficient cause for
KIRK,"A short time, Mister Spock. We have very little."
KIRK,"How's it going, Scotty?"
SCOTT,"Well sir, it's a plumber's nightmare, but it'll hold for a bit."
KIRK,It has to hold longer than a bit.
SCOTT,"Sorry, sir. That's about the best I can do, but I guarantee it's"
KIRK, Kirk here.
KIRK,"I'll be right there. Kirk out. Scotty, ride herd on it. Kind"
SCOTT,"I'll do what I can, sir."
KIRK,"You will proceed from level to level, checking out every foot,"
VANDERBERG,Except the bloody thing.
KIRK,"The creature may or may not attack on sight. However, you must."
SPOCK,"Mister Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the"
VANDERBERG,The twenty-third. Why?
GIOTTO,"Aye, aye, sir. May I ask if you have reason to suspect this"
KIRK,It's one of the possibilities we've discussed.  I
VANDERBERG,"I don't know any safe place, Captain, the way that thing"
KIRK,"Well, gentlemen, you have your instructions. Let's get at it."
KIRK,Mister Spock? Find something?
SPOCK,"Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon, Captain."
KIRK,Traces?
SPOCK,"A life form, Captain. Bearing one hundred eleven degrees,"
KIRK,One of our people?
SPOCK,"No, sir. Silicon."
KIRK,Come on.
SPOCK,"He never even had a chance to fire, Captain."
KIRK,It's only been seconds since we heard him scream. The creature
SPOCK,Captain.
SPOCK,This tunnel. My readings indicate it was made within the hour.
KIRK,Are you certain?
SPOCK,Positive.
KIRK,This tunnel goes back as far as the eye can see. Our best
SPOCK,"Indeed, Captain. I'm quite at a loss."
KIRK,Gone.
SPOCK,Disappeared. Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move
KIRK,These walls are hot.
SPOCK,Indeed. This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes.
KIRK,"Yes, perfectly."
GIOTTO,Did you see it?
KIRK,"Yes, we saw it. Where does the tunnel go?"
SPOCK,Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in
GIOTTO,Did you shoot at it?
KIRK,Yes. We took a bite out of it.
KIRK,It's not animal tissue. What is it?
SPOCK,The closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous
KIRK,Then your guess was right.
SPOCK,It would seem so. Silicon-based.
KIRK,Summation.
SPOCK,"We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks,"
KIRK,That would account for the tunnels.
SPOCK,Correct. This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful
KIRK,Powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber.
SPOCK,And it explains the murdered men.
KIRK,It's definitely phaser resistant. We had our weapons set for
KIRK,"No. No, it might require amassed phasers."
SPOCK,Or a single phaser with much longer contact.
KIRK,"Commander, pass this on to your men We knew it was a killer. Now"
GIOTTO,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"What is it, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, radius"
KIRK,One creature in a hundred miles?
SPOCK,"Exactly. Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels"
KIRK,"Then we're dealing with more than one creature, despite your"
SPOCK,Or it is the last of a race of creatures which made these
KIRK,"Mister Spock, our mission is to protect this colony, to get the"

KIRK,Your orders are shoot to kill. Protect yourself at all times.
GIOTTO,"Aye, aye, sir. Louis, Vinci, take your men out."
KIRK,Mister Spock. Capture it? I don't recall giving any such order.
SPOCK,"You did not, sir. I merely thought that if the opportunity arose"
KIRK,I will lose no more men. The creature will be killed on sight and
SPOCK,"Very well, sir."
KIRK,Mister Spock. I want you to assist Scotty in maintaining that

KIRK,You heard me. It's vital that we keep that reactor in operation.
Your scientific knowledge SPOCK,"Is not needed there, sir. Mister Scott has far more knowledge of"

SPOCK,"Captain, there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in"

KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,Can you fix it again?
SCOTT,"Negative, Captain. It's gone for good."
KIRK,Start immediate evacuation of all colonists

SPOCK,Captain? Are you all right? Jim? Jim!
KIRK,"Yes, Mister Spock, I'm all right. We seem to"

SPOCK,It's possible.

GIOTTO,"Aye, aye, sir."
SPOCK,Murder. Of thousands. Devils! Eternity ends.
MCCOY,What in the name of? What is Spock doing?
KIRK,It's wounded. Badly. You've got to help it.
MCCOY,Help that?
KIRK,Go take a look.
SPOCK,The end of life. Murderers.
MCCOY,You can't be serious. That thing is virtually made out of stone!
KIRK,Help it. Treat it.
MCCOY,"I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer."
KIRK,You're a healer. There's a patient. That's an order. Mister
SPOCK,Understood. It is the end of life. Eternity stops. Go out into
GIOTTO,"The Captain said for you to wait here, and"
APPEL,That murdering monster's in there and we're going to kill it.
GIOTTO,You're going to stay here.
MCCOY," That's right,"
SPOCK, It is time to sleep. It is over. Failure.
KIRK,Mister Spock. Mister Spock. Spock. Spock! Come out of it. I found
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch."
KIRK,The miners must

APPEL,"All right! All right, let's go!"
VANDERBERG,Come on.
KIRK,"How are you doing, Doc?"
MCCOY,I'll let you know.
KIRK,Don't fire. First man that fires is dead.
VANDERBERG,That thing has killed fifty of my men.
KIRK,You've killed thousands of her children.
VANDERBERG,What?
KIRK,Those round silicon nodules that you've been collecting and

KIRK,"Yes, I know. Here's your circulating pump. You've complained this"
VANDERBERG,"Sounds all right, if it will work."
SPOCK,Except for one thing. The Horta is badly wounded. It may die.
MCCOY,"It won't die. By golly, Jim, I'm beginning to think I can cure a"
KIRK,Can you help it?
MCCOY,Help it? I cured it.
KIRK,How?
MCCOY,"Well, I had the ship beam down a hundred pounds of that"
KIRK,"Well, Spock, I'm going to have to ask you to get in touch with"
SPOCK,"It seems logical, Captain. The Horta has a very logical mind."
SPOCK,"Ship ready to leave orbit, Captain. Course"
KIRK,"Very good, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel one.
KIRK,"Fine. Yes, Chief. Kirk here."
VANDERBERG,Just wanted to tell you the eggs have
VANDERBERG,We've already hit huge new pergium
KIRK,"I'm delighted to hear that, Chief. Once"
VANDERBERG,"Well. that's about it, Kirk. Thanks for"
KIRK,"Our pleasure, Chief. Kirk out."
SPOCK,Curious. What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly
MCCOY,"Oh, she did, did she? Now tell me, did she happen to make any"
SPOCK,"Not specifically, but I did get the distinct impression she"
thave the heart to tell her that only I have KIRK,She really liked those ears?
SPOCK,"Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive"
KIRK,Because she approved of you?
SPOCK,"Really, Captain, my modesty"

KIRK,"Damage control, report to the first officer."
SULU,"Captain, the other ship doesn't register. Only drifting debris."
KIRK,"All hands, maintain general alert. Hold battle stations. Damage"
SPOCK,"Minor, Captain. We were most fortunate. Blast damage in decks"
KIRK,"Maintain surveillance, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"No contact, Captain. He blew up all right."
KIRK,"Well, we've been anticipating an attack. I'd say what we've just"
SPOCK,Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act.
UHURA,"Automatic all-points relay from Starfleet Command, Captain, code"
KIRK,"Well, there it is. War. We didn't want it, but we've got it."
SPOCK,Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do
KIRK,"War or not, we've still got a job to do. Denying Organia to the"
SPOCK,"With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy."
KIRK,"Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
SPOCK,"Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain,"
KIRK,We won't get it by talking about it. The trigger's been pulled.
UHURA,Captain. Unit XY-75847 report a fleet of

KIRK,Reception committee?
SPOCK,It would seem so.
AYELBORNE,"You are our visitors. Welcome, welcome. I am Ayelborne."
KIRK,"I am Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise,"
AYELBORNE,"You are most welcome, my friend."
KIRK,I would like to speak to someone in authority.
AYELBORNE,"We don't have anybody in authority, but I am the chairman of"
KIRK,You people are in great danger. Is there someplace we can go and
AYELBORNE,"Oh, yes. Our council chambers are nearby. Please."
SPOCK,"Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the"

AYELBORNE,"We are a simple people, Captain. We have nothing that"
KIRK,You have this planet and its strategic location. I assure you
AYELBORNE,"We have no defences, Captain, nor are any needed."
KIRK,"Gentlemen, I have seen what the Klingons do to planets like"
AYELBORNE,"Captain, we see that your concern is genuine. We are moved."
KIRK,You keep insisting there's no danger. I keep assuring you there
Would you mind telling me AYELBORNE,"It is our way of life, Captain."
KIRK,"That's the first thing that would be lost! Excuse me, gentlemen."
AYELBORNE,"If you will excuse us, Captain, we will discuss your kind"
KIRK,Certainly.
SPOCK,"Captain, our information on these people and their culture was"
KIRK,That doesn't seem likely.
SPOCK,"Nevertheless, it is true. For tens of thousands of years, there"
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock. That might be useful."
AYELBORNE,"We have discussed your offer, Captain. Our opinion is"
KIRK,"Gentlemen, I must get you to reconsider. We can be of immense"
AYELBORNE,"Captain, I can see that you do not understand us. Perhaps"
KIRK," Excuse me, sir. Kirk here."

TREFAYNE,"Ayelborne, several hundred men have appeared near the"
KIRK,How does he know that?
AYELBORNE,"Oh, our friend Trefayne is really quite intuitive. You can"
KIRK,"So we're stranded here, in the middle of a Klingon occupation"
SPOCK,So it would seem. Not a very pleasant prospect.
KIRK,"You have a gift for understatement, Mister Spock. It's not a very"
SPOCK,"Captain, our phasers are gone."
KIRK,Did you take them?
AYELBORNE,"Yes, Captain. I took them."
KIRK,I must ask you to return them.
AYELBORNE,"I'm sorry, Captain. I cannot do that. Were you armed, you"
CLAYMARE,"A Vulcan trader, perhaps. A dealer in kevas and trillium."
KIRK,They know that Vulcan is a member of the Federation.
SPOCK,"Vulcan merchants are not uncommon, Captain. It is a practical"

KOR,"Well, have we a ram among the sheep? Do you object to us taking"
KIRK,He's done nothing. Nothing at all.
KOR,"Coming from an Organian, yours is practically an act of rebellion."
KIRK,You're here. There's nothing I can do about it.
KOR,"Good honest hatred. Very refreshing. However, it makes no"
AYELBORNE,"We shall obey your regulations, Commander."
KOR,"You disapprove, Baroner."
KIRK,You need my approval?
KOR,I need your obedience. Nothing more. Will I have it?
KIRK,You seem to be in command.
KOR,Yes. I am. I shall need a representative from among you. Liaison
KIRK,Me? I don't want the job.
KOR,Have I asked whether or not you want it? We Klingons have a
AYELBORNE,"Commander, I assure you our people want nothing but peace."
KOR,I'm sure you will not. Take the Vulcan to the examination room.
KIRK,And Mister Spock?
KOR,You are concerned?
KIRK,He is my friend.
KOR,You have a poor choice of friends. He will be examined. If he is
KOR,"From this day on, no public assemblages of more than three people."
KOR,You do not like them?  Well?

KLINGON,"I used force four, which is sufficient to break down any"
KOR,"Very well, Lieutenant. Would you like to try our little truth"
KIRK,I don't understand.
KOR,"It's a mind-sifter or mind-ripper, depending on how much force is"
KIRK,And you're proud of it.
KOR,"It is a tool, a weapon. Somewhat drastic, but very efficient."
KIRK,Are you sure you're all right?
SPOCK,"Perfectly, Baroner. But it was an interesting experience."
KOR,"All right, Vulcan, you may go. But you are an enemy alien. You"
If I have to warn you SPOCK,"Not necessary, Commander. I understand you very well."
KOR,"Return to your council, Baroner. You will receive our official"

KIRK,I'll try and avoid it.
SPOCK,"I'm sorry, sir. We did not notice you."
SPOCK,"Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the"
KIRK,"You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you?"
SPOCK,I thought you might.
KIRK,"You're right. But as you say, we still have a job to do."
SPOCK,We'll receive no help from the Organians.
KIRK,"Maybe, but sooner or later they'll start resenting how the"
SPOCK,Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective. Perhaps a more direct
KIRK,That's exactly what I had in mind. Mister Spock Did I or did I
SPOCK,You did.
KIRK,I think it's time we did a little simple and plain communicating.
SPOCK,"A very meritorious idea, Captain."
KIRK,We're short of tools.
SPOCK,I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary.
KIRK,Okay so far. Sonic grenade?
SPOCK,With a delayed action fuse.
SPOCK,These crates contain chemical explosives. They should make a
SPOCK,"Six, five, four three."
KIRK,"You were right, Mister Spock. A most satisfactory display."
KIRK,Of course we blew it up. Deliberately.
AYELBORNE,But that was violence.
KIRK,We did it to show you that you can fight back. You don't have to
CLAYMARE,Terrible to destroy.
KIRK,History is full of examples of civil populations fighting back
SPOCK,"Our fleet will eventually arrive. In the meantime, the battle is"
AYELBORNE,"Captain, I implore you never to do such a thing again."
KIRK,Why? Are you afraid of retribution? Does your personal freedom

KIRK,All I understand is that you apparently don't have the backbone
KOR,You speak of courage. Obviously you do not know the difference
AYELBORNE,"What are you going to do with him, Commander?"
KOR,"What is always done with spies and saboteurs. He will be killed,"
AYELBORNE,"There's no need to use your machine on him, commander. I can"
KIRK,Ayelborne!
KOR,What?  Captain of the USS
but AYELBORNE,"For some reason, he feels that he must destroy you,"
KOR,"That's going to be rather difficult now. Isn't it, Captain? What"
AYELBORNE,"I didn't want you to harm him. I'm sorry, Captain. It was"
KIRK,"I'm used to the idea of dying, but I have no desire to die for"
KOR,"I don't blame you, Captain. Lock up the Vulcan. Take the Captain"
KOR,"You'll have a drink with me, Captain?"
KIRK,"No, thank you."
KOR,"I assure you it isn't drugged. With our mind-scanner, we have no"
KIRK,What do you want from me?
KOR,"Oh, a very great deal, but first I want to talk. Just talk."
KIRK,You think I'm going to sit here and just talk with the enemy?
KOR,"You'll talk. Either here, now, voluntarily, or under our"
KIRK,"Something was destroyed? Nothing inconsequential, I hope."
KOR,"Hardly. They were quite important to us, but they can be replaced."
KIRK,We're nothing like you. We're a democratic body.

KOR,Excellent. Then it shall be a matter of testing each other's

KOR,"I can get what I want through our mind-scanner, but there would be"
KIRK,"It will take a lot longer than that, Commander."
KOR,"Longer than that I will not wait. I respect you, Captain, but this"
SPOCK,"It's no use, Jim. There's no way out."
KIRK,How much of the twelve hours do we have left?
SPOCK,"Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual."
KIRK,I think we can count on them being punctual. Blowing that
These Organians SPOCK,They do not seem to understand. Most peculiar.
KIRK,"Nevertheless, our orders still stand. We've got to make some"
SPOCK,"We may not get the chance, Captain. These walls are very thick."
KIRK,And there are guards every few feet down the hall.
AYELBORNE,"Oh, there you are, gentlemen. I trust you are in good"
KIRK,Go?
AYELBORNE,Yes. Your captors plan to do violence to you. That we cannot
KIRK,You turned us over to them. You expect us to trust you now?
AYELBORNE,"Is there really a choice, Captain? I offer you safety."
KIRK,We can't stay here. This is the first place
AYELBORNE,"They will not come here, Captain. You may believe me."
KIRK,"First you turn us in, then get us out. What are you doing now,"
AYELBORNE,"How little you understand us, Captain."
SPOCK,Nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel.
AYELBORNE,Please do not concern yourself about them.
KIRK,What happened to them?
AYELBORNE,"Why, nothing happened to them, Captain. Nothing at all."
KLINGON,Commander!
KOR,Don't you see I'm busy?
KLINGON,The two Federation prisoners. They're gone.
KOR,You mean they've escaped?
KLINGON,"I swear. No one was at fault. The guards, ten of them were"
KOR,If you're lying to me.
KLINGON,I swear!
KOR,"All right, Lieutenant. Implement Special Occupation Order Number"
KLINGON,Sir!
KIRK,"Is that's all you can do, smile?"
AYELBORNE,"You are free, Captain."
KIRK,"I want to know how I'm free, and why."
SPOCK,"Indeed, there are several questions I would like to ask as well."
KIRK,"This idiotic placidity of yours, your refusal to do anything to"
protect yourselves AYELBORNE,"We have already answered that question. To us, violence is"

KOR,"In the courtyard of my headquarters,"
KIRK,Did you hear them?
AYELBORNE,"Yes, of course, Captain. But nothing has changed."
KIRK,"Well, Mister Spock. It seems it's up to you and me."
SPOCK,"It would appear so, Captain."
KIRK,The Federation has invested a great deal of money in our
SPOCK,But only two. More Organians will die.
KIRK,"No. No more will die on account of us, Mister Spock. Where are"
AYELBORNE,I cannot tell you.
KIRK,You've told us a great deal about how you hate violence. Unless
AYELBORNE,You mean you would actually use force?
KIRK,It's entirely up to you.
TREFAYNE,"Ayelborne, this is of no matter. Perhaps you'd better let him"
He AYELBORNE,"Very well, but it will do you no good. They're in that"
KIRK,"Gentlemen, I have no great love for you, your planet, your"

KIRK,"Come on, Mister Spock, let's get out of here."
CLAYMARE,Brave men.
AYELBORNE,"Yes, but so foolish."
TREFAYNE,"Interesting, however."
AYELBORNE,"Of course, we cannot allow it. To stop them is very bad."
CLAYMARE,It is necessary. They may harm one another.
AYELBORNE,Trefayne.
TREFAYNE,They will wait until darkness.
AYELBORNE,And then?
TREFAYNE,Terrible. Inconceivable. Savage.
AYELBORNE,We will wait.
KIRK,"Mister Spock, can we get those two guards? What would you say the"
SPOCK,"Difficult to be precise, Captain. I should say approximately"
KIRK,"Difficult to be precise? 7,824 to 1?"
SPOCK,"7,824.7 to 1."
KIRK,That's a pretty close approximation.
SPOCK,I endeavour to be accurate.
KIRK,You do quite well. Set your phaser on stun. We're after the top
SPOCK,Very good.
KIRK,"But if the situation calls for it, we kill, is that clear?"
SPOCK,"Clear, Captain."
KIRK,I'll take the one on the left. Fire.
TREFAYNE,It has begun.
AYELBORNE,Very well.
CLAYMARE,It will be hard.
AYELBORNE,Prepare yourselves.
KLINGON,"No results, Commander."
KOR,Nothing?
KLINGON,I cannot understand these people.
KOR,"They know what death is, don't they?"
KLINGON,They do not seem to be worried about anything.
KOR,"Bad enough to be a military governor, but to govern a population"
KLINGON,"Yes, sir."
KOR, Fools! Will I have to kill them all?
KIRK,"If you don't tell me what I want to know, I'll kill you here and"
KLINGON,Yes.
KIRK,Is Kor's office down there?
KLINGON,Yes.
KIRK,What about the hostages? Talk. Talk.
KLINGON,I am to gather two hundred more.
KIRK,To be killed?
KIRK,Mister Spock.
KIRK,"Well, what are the odds now?"
SPOCK,"Less than seven thousand to one, Captain. It's remarkable we've"
KIRK,"Less than seven thousand to one. Well, getting better. Getting"
KIRK,"Just stay where you are, Commander."

KOR,Shall we wait and see the results before you kill me?
KIRK,I don't intend to kill you unless I have to.

LAZARUS,Yes. But impatient. Have you decided to help me yet?
LAZARUS,Is something wrong?
KIRK,No. I have a ship's physician with a strange sense of humour.

KIRK,How'd this beast get aboard my ship?
LAZARUS,He did. Isn't that enough?
KIRK,No. He didn't transport up. A report would've been made.

SPOCK,Why does he need the crystals? For what reason?
LAZARUS,For the same reason that I do. Listen to me. He's humanoid.
KIRK,Sit down. The crystals certainly aren't here. There's an

KIRK,"You may not have reason to thank me, depending on what we find."
LAZARUS,"What do you believe now, Captain?"
KIRK,I believe the missing crystals aren't in your ship. Mister Spock?
SPOCK,Unable to locate the source of radiation.
KIRK,Why not? You had it spotted on the Enterprise.
SPOCK,"It has simply disappeared, Captain."
KIRK,"I want every inch of this terrain checked. Look for footprints,"
LAZARUS,"Captain, look out!"
MCCOY,He's coming out of it now.
LAZARUS,"The thing, the thing."
MCCOY,It's all right. You're on board the Enterprise.
LAZARUS,"The rock, I"
MCCOY,How's your head?
LAZARUS,Aches.
KIRK,You saved my life down there. I want to thank you.
LAZARUS,Why shouldn't I?
KIRK,I have some questions I want to ask you.
MCCOY,"Not now, Jim."
KIRK,It's necessary.
LAZARUS,Go ahead. It's all right.
KIRK,This is a computer report of the evidence you gave at your first

LAZARUS,"Oh, yes. He's fled me across all the years, all the empty"
KIRK,"Lazarus, you're hurt. I know. I sympathise, but I've got four"
LAZARUS,"I told you, he's got them. He took them. The thing! The thing!"
MCCOY,"He's got to get some rest, Jim. And would you get that muscleman"
KIRK,Dismissed.
MCCOY,He's in a lot of pain.
KIRK,Sometimes pain can drive a man harder than pleasure. I'm sure you

KIRK,If Mister Spock says that he needs the tools and that they'll be
EDITH,On one condition. Walk me home? I still have a few questions I'd

EDITH,"You? At his side, as if you've always been there and always"
SPOCK,I'll finish with the furnace.
EDITH,"Captain. Even when he doesn't say it, he does."
EDITH,Why does Spock call you Captain? Were you in the war together?
KIRK,We served together.
EDITH,And you don't want to talk about it? Why? Did you do something
KIRK,"Let me help. A hundred years or so from now, I believe, a famous"
EDITH,"Centuries from now? Who is he? Where does he come from er, where will he"
KIRK,Silly question. Want to hear a silly answer?
EDITH,Yes.
KIRK,A planet circling that far left star in Orion's belt. See?
KIRK,How are the stone knives and bearskins?
SPOCK,I may have found our focal point in time.
KIRK,I think you may also find you have a connection burning someplace.
SPOCK,Yes. I'm overloading those lines. I believe we'll have our
KIRK,Good.
SPOCK,"And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing."
KIRK,Let's see what you have.
SPOCK,I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex.
KIRK,"February 23rd, 1936. Six years from now. (reading below the"
KIRK,How bad?
SPOCK,Bad enough.
KIRK,The President and Edith Keeler.
SPOCK,"It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930"
KIRK,"We know her future. Within six years from now, she'll become very"
SPOCK,"Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year. I saw her obituary."
KIRK,You must be mistaken. They both can't be true.
SPOCK,"Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been"
KIRK,"She has two possible futures then, and depending on whether she"
And McCoy SPOCK,Is the random element.
KIRK,"In his condition, what does he do? Does he kill her?"
SPOCK,Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed. We don't know
KIRK,Get this thing fixed. We must find out before McCoy arrives.
SPOCK,"Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things"
MCCOY,Assassins! Murderers! Murderers! Assassins! You! What planet is
EDITH,Why? What is so funny about man reaching for the moon?
KIRK,How do you know?
EDITH,"I just know, that's all. I feel it. And more, I think that one"
ll take all the money they spend now on war and death KIRK,And make them spend it on life?
EDITH,Yes. You see the same things that I do. We speak the same
KIRK,The very same.
MAN,No!
MCCOY,"I'm glad you got away, too. Why do you think they want to kill"
MAN,"Look, fella, you take a sip too much of that old wood alky, and,"
and almost anything seems like it MCCOY,"Where? Where are we? Earth? The constellations seem right, but."
MAN,"I, I,"
MCCOY,Biped. Small. Good cranial development. No doubt considerable
KIRK,How long before we get a full answer?
SPOCK,I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another

SPOCK,"Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense"
KIRK,"I must know whether she lives or dies, Spock. I must know what to"
MCCOY,"Oh, Miss. That coffee, it just smells wonderful."
EDITH,You look terrible! You'd better sit down. Come on.
MCCOY,I can't. I got to keep moving. I can't let them find me.
EDITH,There's a cot in the back room. They won't find you there. Come
SPOCK,This is how history went after McCoy changed
KIRK,Germany. Fascism. Hitler. They won the Second World War.
SPOCK,Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no

SPOCK,"She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with"
KIRK,No.
SPOCK,And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from
KIRK,How did she die? What day?
SPOCK,"We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I"
KIRK,"Spock, I believe I'm in love with Edith Keeler."
SPOCK,"Jim, Edith Keeler must die."
EDITH,"Hey, now, come on. You're not ready to take on any tigers just"
MCCOY,"The most common question to ask would be, where am I? I don't"
EDITH,Why not?
MCCOY,The only possible answer would conclusively prove that I'm
EDITH,Would you care to try for 30?
MCCOY,"I am unconscious, or demented."
EDITH,I have a friend that talks about Earth the same way that you do.
MCCOY,"I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist. I am Leonard McCoy, Senior"
EDITH,"I don't mean to disbelieve you, but that's hardly a Navy"
MCCOY,"It's quite all right. It's quite all right dear, because I don't"
EDITH,Get some rest.
KIRK,Edith.
EDITH,"Are you following me, sir?"
KIRK,With ulterior motives. Does that please you?
EDITH,"I hope it means (she stumbles on the step and Kirk catches her,"
SPOCK,"Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop."
KIRK,"No, of course you didn't."
SPOCK,"I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died"
KIRK,It's not yet time. McCoy isn't here.
SPOCK,We're not that sure of our facts. Who's to say when the exact
MCCOY,Come in.
EDITH,"Well, you look just fine, Doctor."
MCCOY,Thank you.
EDITH,I thought you might like to see the evening paper.
MCCOY,"No, not particularly. You know, I've convinced myself that this"
EDITH,That's reassuring.
MCCOY,"But if you're not, what are you?"
EDITH,"A friend. When you showed up here, you looked like you could use"
MCCOY,I don't doubt it. What about this place? Do you run it?
EDITH,I try to.
MCCOY,Why?
EDITH,It's necessary.
MCCOY,"Well, it was for me, at least. You may have saved my life."
EDITH,Lots of people drink from the wrong bottle sometimes.
MCCOY,Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from. Allow me to show my
EDITH,We can talk about that later. I have to go. My young man is
MCCOY,A who movie?
EDITH,A Clark Gable. Don't you know?
MCCOY,"Well, I know what a movie is, but."
EDITH,That's very strange. You get some rest. I'll see you later.
EDITH,"If we hurry, maybe we can catch the Clark Gable movie at the"
KIRK,What?
EDITH,"You know, Doctor McCoy said the same thing."
KIRK,McCoy! Leonard McCoy?
EDITH,Yes. He's in the Mission. He's
KIRK,Stay right here. Spock! Stay right there!
SPOCK,What is it?
KIRK,McCoy! He's in
SPOCK,"No, Jim!"
KIRK,Edith.
MCCOY,"You deliberately stopped me, Jim. I could have saved her. Do you"
SPOCK,"He knows, Doctor. He knows."
SCOTT,"What happened, sir? You only left a moment ago."
SPOCK,We were successful.
GUARDIAN,Time has resumed its shape. All is as it was before. Many

KIRK,Let's get the hell out of here.
Operation,Annihilate!
Original Airdate,"13 Apr, 1967"
KIRK,"Anything, Lieutenant?"
UHURA,"No, sir. I've tried every major transmitting station on Deneva."
KIRK,"Try GSK-783, sub-space frequency 3."
UHURA,"But sir, that's a call sign for a private transmitter."
KIRK,"I'm very well aware of that, Lieutenant. Try it."
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Evaluation, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"As I speculated, Captain, the overall pattern of mass insanity"
KIRK,"And next in line, Deneva. Bones, what's your theory about the"
MCCOY,There's no medical or scientific cause for what happened on
KIRK,"But it follows a definite pattern, a systematic progression from"
SULU,"Captain, we're picking up a ship on our sensors, heading directly"
KIRK,"Plot an interception course, Mister Sulu. Warp factor eight."
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
SPOCK,"The ship is a one-man vessel of Denevan configuration, Captain."
KIRK,"Scotty, tractor beams?"
SCOTT,"Out of range, sir."
UHURA,"Making contact, Captain."
KIRK,"Denevan ship, this is the USS Enterprise. Can you reverse your"
SCOTT,"Captain, we'll get too close to the sun."
KIRK,"Keep closing. Denevan ship, reverse your course. Do you hear me?"
SPOCK,Outer hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and
SULU,"He's too close, Captain."
SPOCK,So are we. Hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising. The
m SULU,"He burned up, Captain."
KIRK,Reverse course. One hundred and eighty degrees about.
SULU,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,"All clear, Captain. Hull temperature falling, gravimetric pull"
KIRK,Very well. Reduce to sub-warp speed. Take us to Deneva.
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,That Denevan ship headed deliberately into the sun. Why?
MCCOY,There's one possibility. The mass insanity may have reached this
UHURA,"Captain, I'm having difficulty on that transmitter call to"
KIRK,Keep trying.
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,"Jim, your brother Sam and his family, aren't they stationed on"
SPOCK,"Planet development is normal, Captain."
SCOTT,"Aye, they make regular trips from here carrying supplies to the"
SPOCK,No Federation contacts for over a year.
UHURA,"Captain. I've made contact with your private transmitter, sir."
KIRK,Put it on audio.
Please help us KIRK,"Aurelan, this is Jim on the Enterprise. Repeat your message."
UHURA,"Contact broken, sir."
KIRK,Re-establish.
UHURA,"Sorry, sir."
KIRK,"I'm not interested in your excuses, Lieutenant. Re-establish"
UHURA,"I'm afraid that's impossible at the moment, Captain. They"
KIRK,Keep trying to raise them.
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,"Jim, did you know who that woman was?"
KIRK,Yes. You were right a while back. My brother Sam lives on Deneva.
KIRK,Set your phasers on stun. We're going to beam
SPOCK,Lieutenant Uhura has had no further response to our signals.
KIRK,I'll want a complete transcript of everything that happens down
ZAHRA,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Let's go. Energise.
KIRK,There are almost a million inhabitants of Deneva. There's more
SPOCK,"They're here, Captain. In the buildings. Strangely quiescent."
KIRK,My brother's lab is over there. They signalled us once. There
SPOCK,"Captain, several people approaching."
MEN,Go back! Get away! We don't want to hurt you! Go back! Get out of
KIRK,Stand by to fire. Fire.
KIRK,"Did you hear what they said, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,Indeed. They seemed most concerned for our safety.
KIRK,"They tried to brain us with these clubs. Check them out, Bones."
SPOCK,Their attitude was inconsistent with their actions.
KIRK,To say the least.
MCCOY,"There's something wrong, Jim. Their nervous systems. Unconscious"
KIRK,Fan out. Follow me. Security.
AURELAN,They're here! They're here! Please keep them away!
KIRK, Aurelan.
AURELAN,They're here! They're here!
KIRK,"Bones.  Aurelan, you're safe now."
MCCOY,"Is this your brother, Jim?"
KIRK,Sam. It is my brother. Was my brother.
MCCOY,"I'm sorry, Jim. The boy's unconscious, but he's still alive."
KIRK,Peter?
MCCOY,I'd better get the boy and his mother back to the ship. I can't
KIRK,Get ready to beam up.
MCCOY,McCoy to Enterprise. Prepare to beam up party of four.
SPOCK,"Captain, I understand how you must"
KIRK,"Yes. Yes, Mister Spock. You heard my sister-in-law say something"
SPOCK,"Notice the ventilator, Captain. Apparently they were trying to"
KIRK,It doesn't make sense. There are no harmful life forms reported.
SPOCK,That is correct. I am at a loss to understand it.
MCCOY,"Ready to beam up, Captain. I'd like you to be onboard when your"
KIRK,"Take charge of the landing party, Mister Spock. I want some"
MCCOY,I won't be able to give you the exact cause
KIRK,Can she talk?
MCCOY,Yes.
KIRK,"Aurelan? Aurelan, it's Jim."
AURELAN,"Jim? Sam, he's"
KIRK,He's dead. But your son's still alive. You've got to help us.
AURELAN,"You are here. It is you, Jim."
KIRK,"Yes, I'm here. You have to tell us what happened, Aurelan, to you"
AURELAN,They came eight months ago.
KIRK,Who?
AURELAN,Things. Horrible things! Visitors brought them in their vessel
KIRK,What kind of things?
AURELAN,Not the ship's crew's fault. The things made them bring their
KIRK,"Aurelan, it's important that you tell us. What kind of things?"
AURELAN,Not their fault.
MCCOY,"When she answers questions, any questions, it's as if she's"
AURELAN,"They use it to control us. They're spreading, Jim. They need"
KIRK,My brother's son?
MCCOY,"I'll do everything I can, Jim, to save him."
KIRK,Report.
SPOCK,"The streets are extraordinarily quiet, Captain. We've seen no"
KIRK,You've seen some kind of creature? Any alien form?
SCOTT,"None, sir. Just that noise we heard."
SPOCK,A peculiar buzzing sound. We were about to investigate it.
KIRK,All right. Let's go find out what it is. Set your phasers on
KIRK,Spock!
KIRK,Form a ring. Fire!
SPOCK,Incredible. Not only should it have been destroyed by our
ZAHRA,"Captain, it doesn't even look real."
SPOCK,It is not life as we know or understand it. Yet t is obviously
KIRK,And it can bear up under full phaser power.
SPOCK,"Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard."
KIRK,It's too close in here. It may be a trap in here. Let's move out.
KIRK,"Spock! Spock!  It's gone. Can you stand? Spock,"
MCCOY,Nurse. That's the second time he's come out
CHAPEL,"Doctor, the readings have never looked like that before, not"
MCCOY,Let's prepare to close. Nurse!
CHAPEL,"Doctor, that's not all you're going to do?"
MCCOY,Miss Chapel.
CHAPEL,"Doctor, there is more of it in him, entwined all through his"
MCCOY,"Miss Chapel, if you cannot assist me as required, call another"
KIRK,How is he?
MCCOY,"To be very frank, Jim, I don't know that I can do anything for"
KIRK,Did you operate on Spock in time?
MCCOY,No. I just removed these for examination. His body's full of
KIRK,My nephew?
MCCOY,"The same. Evidently, when the creature attacks, it leaves a"
KIRK,Recommendations?
MCCOY,"I'm sorry, Jim. The lab, the science departments, we're all"
SPOCK,No! No! 
CHAPEL,Mister Spock.
SPOCK," No, I won't."
CHAPEL,Mister Spock.
CHAPEL,"Bridge, this is Sickbay. Tell Doctor McCoy Mister Spock just"
KIRK,"All decks, security alert. Locate and restrain Mister Spock. He"
SPOCK,I must take the ship.
SPOCK,Down! I must take it down.
KIRK,Get him back to the Sickbay. Use security restraints.
MCCOY,The K3 indicator registers the level of
SPOCK,Doctor McCoy. Captain.
KIRK,Spock.
SPOCK,These restraints will no longer be necessary. Nor will your
SPOCK,"I am a Vulcan, Doctor. Pain is a thing of the mind. The mind can"
KIRK,You're only half-Vulcan. What about the human half of you?
SPOCK,"It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable. And"
KIRK,"Can he control it the way he says, Bones?"
MCCOY,"Who knows, Jim? I know the amount of pain the creature can"
but whether he can control it hour to hour SPOCK,"I have my own will, Captain. Let me help."
KIRK,"I need you, Spock, but we can't take any chances. We'll keep you"
MCCOY,Yes.
KIRK,Help them. I don't care what it takes or costs. You've got to
MCCOY,"Jim, aren't you forgetting something? There are over a million"
SPOCK,I am a Vulcan. I am a Vulcan. There is no pain.
SCOTT,"Mister Spock, I thought you were still"
SPOCK,I was.
SCOTT,"Here, now. Where do you think you're going?"
SPOCK,I have an errand on the planet's surface. You will beam me down
SCOTT,"Not likely, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"That is an order, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,"Aye, sir, and I'm sorry I have to disobey it. The Captain said"
SCOTT,"Freeze right there, Mister Spock, or I'll put you to sleep for"
KIRK,"Mister Spock, I gave you an order to stay in the Sickbay."
SPOCK,"Until the pain was gone, Captain. It has been discontinued by"
KIRK,Scotty?
SCOTT,"He said he was transporting down to the surface, sir. Your"
SPOCK,"One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed,"
MCCOY,"Jim, this is ridiculous. I don't want my patients running"
SPOCK,"I am in complete control of myself, Doctor. The fact that I am"
KIRK,"Mister Spock, your logic, as usual, is inescapable. Beam him"
SPOCK,"Thank you, Captain."
KIRK,Energise.
MCCOY,"Jim, that man is sick. Don't give me any"
KIRK,"I don't have to, Bones. We both know he is."
SPOCK,"Come in, gentlemen. I believe you'll find this interesting."
MCCOY,"You may be controlling the pain, Mister Spock, but you're far"
SPOCK,"Unimportant at the moment, Doctor. Please observe. Interesting,"
KIRK,Yes. That would answer a lot of questions.
SPOCK,"Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain?"
KIRK,I think so. This may be one cell in a larger organism. An
SPOCK,"And although it is not physically connected to the other cells,"
KIRK,Existing so differently from any living matter or energy as we
SPOCK,From a place where our physical laws do not apply. We may

SPOCK,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,"I'm sorry, Captain. I've tried everything I can. Variant"
KIRK,Then you're wasting your time. There has to be something that'll
MCCOY,"Which happens to be my point. The thing won't die, even at"
KIRK,"I can't accept that, Bones. We've got fourteen science labs"
MCCOY,"Captain, I understand your concern. Your affection for Spock,"
KIRK,"No, no, Bones. There's more than two lives at stake here. I"
KIRK,Gentlemen.
SPOCK,"I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain. We already know"
MCCOY,"Gentlemen, I want it stopped, too, but not at the cost of"
SPOCK,"Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew."
MCCOY,"If killing five people saves ten, it's a bargain. Is that your"
KIRK,"I will accept neither of those alternatives, gentlemen. I cannot"
KIRK,Report.
MCCOY,"I'm sorry, Jim. We've been over and over it, made every"

SPOCK,"Captain, I do not make this request lightly. I do not know how"
KIRK,Request denied. There must be another answer. Something in the

MCCOY,"Jim, we've been through it and through it. Radiation, heat"
KIRK,But one other thing you haven't mentioned. It's bright. It

MCCOY,"You can't move Deneva closer to the sun, Jim."
KIRK,"No, but you can move the equivalent of the sun to Deneva. Mister"
SPOCK,"Yes. In essence, it can be done. A string of satellites around"
MCCOY,"Well, I can rig a test cubicle in the bio-lab, put our specimen"

KIRK,"Your figures are, of course, accurate."
SPOCK,Of course. The light of the sun at the proximity where the
CHAPEL,"Ready, Doctor."
MCCOY,Put on your masks.
MCCOY,Completed.
MCCOY,"It worked! We can do it. What's the matter, Jim? We can do it."
KIRK,It worked in a lab. With the creature exposed to everything we
MCCOY,"Well, I don't know. Maybe trial"
KIRK,"Maybe. There's no time for maybes, Bones. We need to know now."
MCCOY,But I'd have to put a
KIRK,"Yes, we'd have to put someone who's infected under that light."
MCCOY,Do you have any idea of the risk?
KIRK,"We have to duplicate the conditions on the planet, and Spock"
SPOCK,"Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to"
MCCOY,Do you know what one million candlelight per square inch can do
KIRK,"There's no other way, Bones. We have to duplicate the brilliance"
MCCOY,All right. I'll rig up a protective pair of goggles.
SPOCK,"There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor."
KIRK,I agree completely.
MCCOY,"Unfortunately, you're both right. It's the only thing we can do."
MCCOY,Mister Spock's the best first officer in the fleet.
KIRK,Proceed.
MCCOY,Completed.
KIRK,"Spock, are you all right?"
SPOCK,The creature within me is gone. I am free of it and the pain.
SPOCK,"And I'm also quite blind. An equitable trade, Doctor. Thank you."
CHAPEL,"Doctor, the results of the first tests on the creature's"
MCCOY," Oh, no."
KIRK,What is it?
MCCOY,I threw the total spectrum of light at the creature. It wasn't
SPOCK,Interesting. Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which
KIRK,Are you telling me that Spock need not have been blinded?
MCCOY,"I didn't need to throw the blinding white light at all, Jim."
I SPOCK,Doctor it was my selection as well. It is done.
KIRK,"Bones, take care of him."
SULU,"Completing the seeding orbit, Captain. Two"
KIRK,Good. Scanners?
SCOTT,"Scanners ready, sir."
SULU,"Ready, Captain."
KIRK,"Satellite control, this is the Captain. Energise all satellites."
SCOTT,"All satellites operative, Captain."
UHURA,"Captain, receiving messages from a ground station."
KIRK,Report.
UHURA,"The things are dying, sir. It's working."
KIRK,Sickbay.
MCCOY,McCoy here.
KIRK,Tell Spock it worked.
MCCOY,"Yes, Captain. He'll be happy to hear that."
KIRK,"Bones, it wasn't your fault."
KIRK,Bones.
KIRK,"Yeoman, record this for Starfleet Command."
ZAHRA,"Ready, sir."
KIRK,The alien creatures on Deneva have been destroyed
ZAHRA,"Captain, look. Mister Spock."
KIRK,Spock. You can see.
MCCOY,"The blindness was temporary, Jim. There's something about his"
SPOCK,"An hereditary trait, Captain. The brightness of the Vulcan sun"
KIRK,Mister Spock. Regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience
SPOCK,"Quite the contrary, Captain. I had a very strong reaction. My"
MCCOY,'Tis a pity your brief blindness did not increase your

SPOCK,"My pleasure, Captain."
MCCOY,Unusual eye arrangement. I might've known he'd turn up with
KIRK,"What's that, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"I said, please don't tell Spock I said he was the best first"
SPOCK,"Why, thank you, Doctor McCoy."
KIRK,"You've been so concerned about his Vulcan eyes, Doctor, you"
SULU,"Warp factor one, sir."
Original Airdate,"15 Sep, 1967"
MCCOY,"Oh, Captain. Got a minute?"
KIRK,A minute.
MCCOY,It's Spock. Have you noticed anything strange about him?
KIRK,"No, nothing in particular. Why ?"
MCCOY,"Well, it's nothing I can pinpoint without an examination, but"
KIRK,That just sounds like Mister Spock in one of his contemplative
MCCOY,Miss Chapel.
CHAPEL, Doctor McCoy.
MCCOY,Captain.
CHAPEL,Captain.
MCCOY,What's this?
CHAPEL,Oh.
MCCOY,"Oh! Vulcan plomeek soup, and I'll bet you made it too. You never"
CHAPEL,"Well, Mister Spock hasn't been eating, Doctor, and I, I just"
MCCOY,"It's all right. Carry on, Miss Chapel."
KIRK,"Bones, I'm a busy man."
MCCOY,"Jim, when I suggested to Spock that it was time for his routine"
KIRK,Spock said that?
SPOCK,"Captain, I should like to request a leave of absence on my home"
KIRK,"Spock, what the devil is this all about?"
SPOCK,"I have made my request, Captain. All I require from you is that"
KIRK,"All right, Spock, let's have it."
SPOCK,It is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is
KIRK,I'm more interested in your request for shore leave. In all the
years SPOCK,"You have my request, Captain. Will you grant it or not?"
KIRK,"In all the years that I've known you, you've never asked for a"
SPOCK,"Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated."
KIRK,"Agreed, but that isn't the question, is it? If there's a problem"
illness in the family SPOCK,"No. Nothing of that nature, Captain."
KIRK,"Then since we're headed for Altair Six, and since the shore"
facilities there are excellent SPOCK,No! I must. I wish to take my leave on Vulcan.
KIRK,"Spock, I'm asking you. What's wrong?"
SPOCK,I need rest. I'm asking you to accept that answer.
KIRK,Bridge. Helm.
KIRK,Alter course to Vulcan. Increase speed to warp four.
SPOCK,"Thank you, Captain."
KIRK,I suppose most of us overlook the fact that even Vulcans aren't
SPOCK,No.  We're not.
UHURA,"Captain, something's coming in on the"
KIRK,"Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"Message complete, sir. Switching over."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, acknowledge that message."
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance."
CHEKOV, We'll have to head directly there
KIRK,"Head directly for Altair Six. Sailor's luck, Mister Spock. Or, as"
SPOCK,"I quite understand, Captain."
KIRK,Bridge. Navigation.
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, how late will we arrive for the ceremonies if we"
KIRK,How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us?
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out."
KIRK,"Mister Spock. Come with me, please."
KIRK,"Deck five. You've changed course for Vulcan,"
SPOCK,Changed the course?
KIRK,Do you deny it?
SPOCK,"No. No, by no means, Captain. It is quite possible."
KIRK,Then why'd you do it?
SPOCK,"Captain, I accept on your word that I did it, but I do not know"
KIRK,"I'm trying to help you, Spock."
SPOCK,Ask me no further questions. I will not answer.
KIRK,I order you to report to the Sickbay.
SPOCK,Sickbay?
KIRK,Complete examination. McCoy's waiting.
MCCOY,"Come in, Spock. I'm all ready for you."
SPOCK,"My orders were to report to Sickbay, Doctor. I have done so. And"
MCCOY,My orders were to give you a thorough physical. In case you
SPOCK,"Examine me, for all the good it'll do either of us."
SULU,"How do you figure it, Chekov? First we're"
CHEKOV,I think I'm going to get space sick.
MCCOY,"Jim, you've got to get Spock to Vulcan."
KIRK,"Bones, I will, I will. As soon as this mission is"
MCCOY,No! Now. Right away. If you don't get him to Vulcan within a
KIRK,Why must he die? Why within eight days? Explain.
MCCOY,I don't know.
KIRK,"You keep saying that. Are you a doctor, or aren't you?"
MCCOY,"There's a growing imbalance of body functions, as if in our"
KIRK,You say you're convinced he knows what it is?
MCCOY,"He does, and he's as tightlipped about it as an Aldebaran"
SPOCK,Come.
KIRK,Stay. McCoy has given me his medical evaluation of your
SPOCK,It is a thing no out-worlder may know except those very few who
KIRK,"No, I do not understand. Explain. Consider that an order."
SPOCK,"Captain, there are some things which transcend even the"
KIRK,Would it help if I told you that I'll treat this as totally
SPOCK,It has to do with biology.
KIRK,What?
SPOCK,Biology.
KIRK,What kind of biology?
SPOCK,Vulcan biology.
KIRK,You mean the biology of Vulcans? Biology as in reproduction?
SPOCK,"The birds and the bees are not Vulcans, Captain. If they were,"
KIRK,I guess the rest of us assume that it's done quite logically.
SPOCK,No. No. It is not. We shield it with ritual and customs shrouded
KIRK,"But you're not a fish, Mister Spock. You're"
SPOCK,No. Nor am I a man. I'm a Vulcan. I'd hoped I would be spared
KIRK,"I haven't heard a word you've said, and I'll get you to Vulcan"
UHURA,"Starfleet Command. Yes, sir."
CHEKOV,"Mister Sulu, you don't think"
SULU,"Maybe you ought to plot a course back for Vulcan, just in case."
Thecaptain asked me to SPOCK,Let me alone. Let me alone!
KIRK,"I'm aware of that, sir, but it's of the utmost importance. You"
KIRK,"I can't, sir, but believe me, I wouldn't make such a request"
KIRK,"Sir, the delay would be, at most, a day. I can hardly believe"
MCCOY,"Well, that's that."
KIRK,"No, it's not. I know the Altair situation. We would be one of"
MCCOY,You can't go off to Vulcan against Starfleet orders. You'll be
busted KIRK,"I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones? And he will if we go to"
CHEKOV,Bridge. Navigation.
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Vulcan."
CHEKOV,"Course already plotted. Laying it in, sir."
KIRK,"I see. Very well. Carry on, Mister Chekov."
SPOCK,Miss Chapel.
CHAPEL,"Yes, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,I had a most startling dream. You were trying to tell me
CHAPEL,I don't understand.
SPOCK,Your face is wet.
CHAPEL,I came to tell you that we are bound for Vulcan. We'll be there
SPOCK,Vulcan. Miss Chapel.
CHAPEL,My name is Christine.
SPOCK,"Yes, I know, Christine. Would you make me some of that plomeek"
CHAPEL,"Oh, I'd be very glad to do that, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Bridge.
SPOCK,"It is obvious that you have surmised my problem, Doctor. My"
KIRK,Will I? You've been most patient with my kinds of madness.
SPOCK,Then would you beam down to the planet's surface and stand with
KIRK,Is it permitted?
SPOCK,"It is my right. By tradition, the male is accompanied by his"
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,I also request McCoy accompany me.
MCCOY,"I shall be honoured, sir."
UHURA,Captain. We're standing by on Vulcan hailing
KIRK,"Open the channel, Lieutenant. Vulcan Space Central, this is the"
SPOCK,This is Spock.
CHAPEL,"Doctor, what's going on?"
SPOCK,"T'Pring, parted from me and never parted, never and always"
UHURA,"She's lovely, Mister Spock. Who is she?"
SPOCK,She is T'Pring. My wife.
SPOCK,This is the land of my family. It has been held by us for more
MCCOY,He called it Koon-ut what?
KIRK,He described it to me as meaning marriage or challenge. In the
MCCOY,And they still go mad at this time. Perhaps the price they pay
KIRK,It's lovely. I wish the breeze were cooler.
MCCOY,Yeah. Hot as Vulcan. Now I understand what that phrase means.
KIRK,The atmosphere is thinner than Earth.
MCCOY,I wonder when his T'Pring arrives.
SPOCK,The marriage party approaches. I hear them.
KIRK,Marriage party? You said T'Pring was your wife.
SPOCK,By our parents' arrangement. A ceremony while we were but seven
KIRK,"Bones, you know who that is? T'Pau. The only person to ever turn"
MCCOY,T'Pau. Officiating at Spock's wedding?
KIRK,He never mentioned that his family was this important.
PAU,"Spock, are our ceremonies for outworlders?"
SPOCK,They are not outworlders. They are my friends. I am permitted
SPOCK,This is Kirk.
KIRK,Ma'am.
PAU,And thee are called?
MCCOY,"Leonard McCoy, ma'am."
PAU,Thee names these out worlders friends. How does thee pledge
SPOCK,"With my life, T'Pau."
PAU,What they are about to see comes down from the time of the
PRING,Kal-if-fee!
KIRK,What is it? What happened?
PAU,She chooses the challenge.
MCCOY, With him?
PAU,He acts only if cowardice is seen. She will choose her champion.
KIRK,Spock?
PAU,"Do not attempt to speak with him, Kirk. He is deep in the"
KIRK,We'll stay.
PAU,Spock chose his friends well.
MCCOY,"Ma'am, I don't understand. Are you trying to say that she"
PAU,"He will have to fight for her. It is her right. T'Pring, thee"
PRING,I am prepared.
PAU,"Spock, does thee accept the challenge according to our laws and"
KIRK,Think Spock can take him?
MCCOY,I doubt it. Not in his present condition.
PAU,"T'Pring, thee will choose thy champion."
PRING,"As it was in the dawn of our days, as it is today, as it will"
STONN,No! I am to be the one. It was agreed.
PAU,Be silent.
STONN,Hear me. I have made the ancient claim. I claim the right. The
PAU,Kroykah!
STONN,I ask forgiveness.
PAU,"Kirk? T'Pring is within her rights, but our laws and customs are"
SPOCK,T'Pau.
PAU,Thee speaks?
SPOCK,My friend does not understand.
PAU,"The choice has been made, Spock. It is up to him now."
SPOCK,"He does not know. I will do what I must, T'Pau, but not with"
PAU,It is said thy Vulcan blood is thin. Are thee Vulcan or are thee
SPOCK,"I burn, T'Pau. My eyes are flame. My heart is flame. Thee has"
PAU,Thee has prided thyself on thy Vulcan heritage. It is decided.
KIRK,What happens to Spock if I decline?
PAU,"Another champion will be selected. Do not interfere, Kirk. Keep"
MCCOY,"You can't do it, Jim."
KIRK,I can't?
MCCOY,No. She said their laws and customs were not binding on you.
KIRK,And you said Spock might not be able to handle him. If I can
knock Spock out without really hurting him MCCOY,"In this climate? If the heat doesn't get you, the thin air will."
KIRK,"If I get into any trouble, I'll quit. And Spock wins, and honour"
MCCOY,"Jim, listen, if you"
KIRK,Bones. He's my first officer and my friend. I disregarded
PAU,"It is done. Kirk, decide."
KIRK,I accept the challenge.
PAU,"Here begins the act of combat for possession of the woman,"
PAU,"If both survive the lirpa, combat will continue with the ahn"
KIRK,"What do you mean, if both survive?"
PAU,This combat is to the death.
KIRK,"Now wait a minute, ma'am. Who said anything about a fight to the"
MCCOY,These men are friends. To force them to fight until one of them
PAU,I can forgive such a display only once. Challenge was given and
MCCOY,Spock! No!
PAU,Kroykah!
MCCOY,Is this Vulcan chivalry? The air's too hot and thin for Kirk.
PAU,The air is the air. What can be done?
MCCOY, I can compensate for the atmosphere and the
PAU,Thee may proceed.
MCCOY,"You're going to have to kill him, Jim."
KIRK,"Kill Spock? That's not what I came to Vulcan for, is it? What's"
MCCOY,It's a tri-ox compound. It'll help you breathe. Now be careful!
KIRK,Sound medical advice.
PAU,The ahn woon.
PAU,Kroykah!
PAU,I grieve with thee.
MCCOY,McCoy to Enterprise.
MCCOY,Have the transporter room stand by to beam up the landing party.
SPOCK,Yes. I'll follow you up in a few minutes. You will instruct
PRING,Specify.
SPOCK,"Why the challenge, and why you chose my captain as your"
PRING,"Stonn wanted me, I wanted him."
SPOCK,I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me.
PRING,"You have become much known among our people, Spock. Almost a"
SPOCK,Logical. Flawlessly logical.
PRING,I am honoured.
SPOCK,"Stonn. She is yours. After a time, you may find that having is"
PAU,"Live long and prosper, Spock."
SPOCK,I shall do neither. I have killed my captain and my friend.
SPOCK,"Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission"
MCCOY,"Spock, I"
SPOCK,So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements.
MCCOY,"Spock, I"
SPOCK,"Doctor, please, let me finish. There can be no excuse for the"
KIRK,Don't you think you better check with me first?
SPOCK,Captain! Jim!
SPOCK,"I'm pleased to see you, Captain. You seem uninjured. I am at"
KIRK,Blame McCoy. That was no tri-ox compound he shot me with. He
SPOCK,Indeed.
MCCOY,"Nurse, would you mind, please?"
MCCOY,"Spock, what happened down there? The girl? The wedding?"
SPOCK,"Ah, yes, the girl. Most interesting. It must have been the"

UHURA,Captain Kirk. Message from Starfleet
KIRK,"Relay it, Lieutenant."
UHURA,Response to T'Pau's request for diversion of
KIRK,"Well, a little late, but I'm glad they're seeing it our way. How"
MCCOY,"There's just one thing, Mister Spock. You can't tell me that"
SPOCK,Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a
KIRK,"Yes, Mister Spock. I understand."
SPOCK,"Thank you, Captain."
MCCOY,"Of course, Mister Spock, your reaction was quite logical."
SPOCK,"Thank you, Doctor."
MCCOY,In a pig's eye!
KIRK,"Come on, Spock. Let's go mind the store."
Original Airdate,"22 Sep, 1967"
CAROLYN,"Here's the report on Pollux Five,"
KIRK,"Bugs the? Well, carry out the standard procedures on Pollux Four."
CAROLYN,"Aye, sir."
MCCOY,"Lieutenant, you look a bit tired this morning."
CAROLYN,"Well, I was up all night working on this report, sir."
SCOTT,"Well in that case, there's nothing like a wee bit of coffee to"
CAROLYN,"All right, Scotty. Just let me give this to Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Bones, could you get that excited over a cup of coffee?"
MCCOY,Even from here I can tell his pulse rate's up.
SCOTT,"Gentlemen. Come along, my dear."
MCCOY,"I'm not sure I like that, Jim."
KIRK,"Why, Bones? Scotty's a good man."
MCCOY,"And he thinks he's the right man for her, but I'm not sure she"
KIRK,I like to think of it not so much losing an officer as gaining
SCOTT,Come along.
KIRK,"Actually, I'm losing an officer."
CHEKOV,"Entering standard orbit around Pollux Four, sir."
KIRK,"Cartographic Detail, stand by."
UHURA,"Standing by, sir."
KIRK,"Preliminary reports, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Pollux Four. Class M type planet, oxygen and nitrogen"
KIRK,"Cartographic Sections, implement standard orders."
UHURA,All cartographic standards full automatic.
SULU,Captain?
MCCOY,What in the name of?
KIRK,"Analysis, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Momentarily.
CHEKOV,Am I seeing things?
SULU,"Not unless I am, too. Captain, that thing's a giant hand."
KIRK,"What is it, Mister Spock? Is it a hand?"
SPOCK,"Negative, Captain. Not living tissue."
KIRK,"A trick, then? A projection?"
SPOCK,"Not a projection, sir. A field of energy."
KIRK,Hard about.
SULU,Hard about. We can't seem to get away from it.
UHURA,It's almost as if it means to grab us.
KIRK,Reverse all engines.
SULU,All engines reverse.
SULU,"We're dead still, Captain. Helm doesn't answer. We can't move."
KIRK,"Lieutenant, relay our position and"
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,Mister Sulu try rocking the ship. Full impulse power forward and
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,"Damage report coming in, Captain. Situation under control. Minor"
MCCOY,"Sickbay reports five minor injuries, all being treated."
KIRK,Thank you. Mister Sulu?
SULU,"Applying thrust, sir. No results, Captain. We're stuck tight."
KIRK,Mister Spock. Status.
SPOCK,The ship is almost completely encircled by the field. It

SULU,"Aye, aye, sir. Standing by."
KIRK,Activate.
SULU,"Ineffective, Captain. There doesn't seem to be anything to push"
SPOCK,"Captain, a most curious development on scanner five seven."
KIRK,"Let's all take a look at it, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Screen on, Captain."
UHURA,"Activity on hailing channel three, sir."
KIRK,"Response frequencies, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"Calculated. Channel open, sir."
KIRK,"This is Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the USS Enterprise."
KIRK,Are you responsible for stopping the ship?
KIRK,"Give it back, then we'll talk."
KIRK,"I don't know who or what you are, but I must warn you we have the"
KIRK,Never mind the history lesson. Release the ship!
SCOTT,"External pressure building up, Captain. Eight hundred GSC and"
KIRK,Compensate.
SCOTT,One thousand GSC and climbing. (The crew react to increasing air
KIRK,"All right! Whatever you're doing, turn it off! You win!"
SCOTT,"Pressure is gone, Captain. Space normal on hull."
KIRK,"Let's go, Bones. You in good voice?"
MCCOY,"Sure it's wise, Jim?"
KIRK,"If we don't accept his invitation, we'll have a crushed eggshell"
SPOCK,"Verbose, isn't he?"
KIRK,"Insulted, Spock?"
SPOCK,Insults are effective only where emotion is present.
KIRK,Good. We'll tackle him together. We already know the questions.
KIRK,Tricorders.
CAROLYN,"What am I doing down here, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"Well, you're the A and A officer, aren't you? Archaeology,"
CAROLYN,Correct.
MCCOY,We're going to need help in all those areas.
KIRK,Come on.
APOLLO,"My children, long have I waited for this moment. The memories"
KIRK,You know of Earth? You've been there?
APOLLO,"Once I stretched out my hand, and Earth trembled. And I"
KIRK,"You mentioned Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus. How do you know about"
APOLLO,"Search your most distant memories, those of the thousands of"
CHEKOV,And I am the tsar of all the Russias.
KIRK,Mister Chekov.
CHEKOV,"I'm sorry, Captain. I never met a god before."
KIRK,"And you haven't yet. Readings, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Simple humanoid, Captain."
KIRK,Evidently not so simple.
APOLLO,"Earth, mother of the most beautiful of women in the universe."
KIRK,All right. We're here at your invitation. Would you mind telling
APOLLO,You will not leave this place.
KIRK,Transporter room.
APOLLO,Your transportation device no longer functions.
KIRK,"Enterprise, come in."
APOLLO,"I will not permit that device to work, either, Captain."
KIRK,What is it you want?
APOLLO,"You will worship me, as your fathers did before you."
KIRK,"If you want to play god and call yourself Apollo, that's your"
APOLLO,I said you would worship me.
KIRK,And you've got a lot to learn!
APOLLO,And so have you! Let the lesson begin! (Apollo grows as tall as

KYLE,Transporter and communications?
SPOCK,"Very efficient. Mister Sulu, rig all transmission circuits for"
SULU,"Working, sir."
SPOCK,"Lieutenant Kyle, I want a complete sensor scan of the planet."
KYLE,Aye sir.
SPOCK,Locate all the lifeforms. I want to know what's going on down
MCCOY,"To coin a phrase, fascinating."
KIRK,"Analysis. Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo?"
CAROLYN,"Apollo, twin brother of Artemis, son of the god Zeus and Leto,"
KIRK,And this thing? 
CAROLYN,Obviously he has some knowledge of Earth. His classical
KIRK,I think the appearance of this is for our benefit. Bones?
MCCOY,I can't say much till I check our these readings. He looks
CHEKOV,"Whatever he is, he seems to control a remarkable technology."
SCOTT,Power is what he controls. You can't do tricks like that without
KIRK,"Fine, but what power, and where is it? Scout around with your"
MCCOY,Yes?
KIRK,"Bones, I wonder if five thousand years ago"
MCCOY,You have a theory?
KIRK,I have an idea. What if he is really Apollo?
MCCOY,What?
CAROLYN,Captain.
APOLLO,"I want from you that which is rightfully mine. Your loyalty,"
MCCOY,May I ask what you offer in exchange for this worship?
APOLLO,Life in paradise. As simple and as pleasureful as it was those
KIRK,"Apollo, we're willing to talk, but you'll find we don't bow to"
APOLLO,"Agamemnon was one such as you, and Hercules. Pride and"
SCOTT,I would like to point out that we are quite capable of some
KIRK,I have four hundred and thirty people on that ship up there.
APOLLO,"No, you do not, Captain. They are mine. To save, to cherish, or"
CAROLYN,But why? What you've said so far makes no sense at all.
APOLLO,"How like Aphrodite and Athena. The beauty, grace. And you seem"
CAROLYN,Lieutenant Palamas.
APOLLO,I mean your name.
CAROLYN,Carolyn.
APOLLO,Carolyn. Yes. You are beautiful. You would do Aphrodite credit.
SCOTT,Leave her alone.
APOLLO,You protest? You risk much.
SCOTT,And so do you.
KIRK,Scotty.  Very impressive.
APOLLO,I've grown weary of discussion and argument.
CHEKOV,"Captain, the phasers. All the working parts are fused."
APOLLO,None of your toys will function. Yes. You are a beauty. But
CAROLYN,"Oh, it's beautiful."
APOLLO,Yes. Come. 
SCOTT,She's not going with you.
APOLLO,He shall learn the discipline of the temple. So shall you all.
CAROLYN,"It's all right, Captain. I'll go."
APOLLO,Without fear. She is fit indeed.
KIRK,"Bones, how is he?"
MCCOY,Stunned but coming around. I'm not sure it's wise to let her go
KIRK,He would have been rather difficult to stop.
MCCOY,"You saw how capricious he is. Benevolent one minute, angry the"
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation."
CHEKOV,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"How do you feel, Scotty?"
SCOTT,I am tingling all over. Did he take her with him?
KIRK,It would seem so.
SCOTT,"Captain, we've got to stop him. He wants her. The way he looks"
KIRK,"Mister Scott, I understand your concern over her, but she"
SCOTT,"I'm able, sir."
KIRK,And one more thing. I want no more unauthorised action against
SCOTT,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"Besides, you stiff-necked thistle head, you could have gotten"
SCOTT,Aye.
MCCOY,Scotty doesn't believe in gods.
KIRK,"Apollo's no god. But he could have been taken for one, though,"
MCCOY,"Yes. To the simple shepherds and tribesmen of early Greece,"
KIRK,Especially if they had the power to alter their form at will and
SPOCK,"Ready to reverse polarity, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,"Computed and standing by to generate, sir."
SPOCK,Activate all units.
SULU,"No good, Mister Spock. We didn't even faze it. We're still locked"
SPOCK,"Cut power, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant, we must restore"
UHURA,"I'm working, sir, but I can't do anything with this."
SPOCK,Oh?
UHURA,I might be able to rig up a subspace bypass circuit.
SPOCK,"Good. Do so. Sensor report, Mister Kyle."
KYLE,"I've located the landing party, but one of them seems separated"
SPOCK,And Apollo?
KIRK,"I've just picked up readings for our own people, sir."
SULU,"Mister Spock, here's something. There seems to be a radiated"
SPOCK,Origin?
SULU,I can't seem to pinpoint it.
SPOCK,"I would suggest, Mister Sulu, if you cannot find out where the"
SULU,"The whole planet, sir? Yes, sir. The whole planet."
CAROLYN,"Oh, it's lovely."
APOLLO,"I've known other women. Daphne, Cassandra, but none more"
CAROLYN,"Frightened? No, I don't think so. Of course, a girl doesn't go"
walking with a APOLLO,A god?
CAROLYN,"All right, a god every day. What happened to the others?"
APOLLO,They returned to the cosmos on the wings of the wind.
CAROLYN,You mean they died?
APOLLO,"No, not as you understand it. We're immortal, we gods. But the"
CAROLYN,You really think you're a god?
APOLLO,"In a real sense, we were gods. We had the power of life and"
CAROLYN,But you said the others didn't die.
APOLLO,"Even for a god, there's a point of no return. Hera was first."
CAROLYN,I don't understand.
APOLLO,"Even five thousand years ago, the gods took mortals to them to"
CHEKOV,There is a repeated occurrence of
KIRK,"Apollo has no difficulty focusing. He taps that energy, Mister"
CHEKOV,"Sir, some creatures can generate and control energy with no"
the fluffy MCCOY,"Not the whole encyclopaedia, Chekov."
CHEKOV,The captain requires complete information.
MCCOY,"Spock's contaminating this boy, Jim."
KIRK,"Are you suggesting that he, Apollo, taps a flow of energy and"
CHEKOV,"That would seem most likely, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, I think you've earned your pay for the week. But"
MCCOY,Number one on our list of things to do.
KIRK,Is that all you have to offer?
MCCOY,"Yes, except my estimation for his physical condition. In spite"
KIRK,"Bones, is it possible"
MCCOY,Jim.
KIRK,Where's Lieutenant Palamas?
APOLLO,She is no longer of any concern to you.
SCOTT,"You bloodthirsty Saracen, what have you done with her?"
KIRK,Scotty!
MCCOY,Not good. Severe shock.
KIRK,"All right, mister. You wanted worshippers? You've got enemies."
APOLLO,You will learn discipline. You will learn
MCCOY,"Chekov, give me a hand."
KIRK,Take care of Scotty.
CHEKOV,"Are you all right, Captain?"
KIRK,Where's Apollo?
CHEKOV,He disappeared again like the cat in that Russian story.
KIRK,"Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire Cat?"
CHEKOV,"Cheshire? No, sir. Minsk perhaps, but"
KIRK,"All right, all right, all right."
CHEKOV,"Sir, there is something I noticed. Apollo looked very strange"
KIRK,"Very good, Mister Chekov. That might very well mean something."
MCCOY,How do you feel?
SCOTT,I can't get my arm to move.
MCCOY,Some neural damage.
KIRK,We've got to get out of here.
CHEKOV,How?
KIRK,"Well, let's assume that five thousand years ago creatures like"
MCCOY,Makes sense.
KIRK,Most mythology has its basis in fact. If I remember my ancient

UHURA,"Yes, sir. Right away."
SPOCK,"Progress, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,Sectors one through twenty five charted and examined. No chance
SPOCK,Continue the search.
SULU,"Aye, sir. Fourteen B by twenty six index."
SPOCK,Mister Kyle.
KYLE,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,"We're unable to break completely loose from this force field,"
KYLE,"What for, sir?"
SPOCK,To shoot through. It might also relieve Lieutenant Uhura's
KYLE,"Right away, sir."
APOLLO,Come here! I know you're trying to escape me. It's useless. I
KIRK,You know nothing about our kind. You know only our remote
APOLLO,But you're of the same nature. I could sweep you out of
KIRK,Mankind has no need for gods. We find the one quite adequate.
APOLLO,"We shall not debate, mortal. I offer you eternal rest and"
KIRK,We're busy.  Look after the girl.
APOLLO,"You will gather laurel leaves, light the ancient fires, kill a"
KIRK,Go! Gather laurel leaves? You must be joking!
ALL,Ha ha ha ha.
MCCOY,Kill a deer. That's the funniest thing I ever heard.
CAROLYN,Captain.
KIRK,"Lieutenant, get back."
APOLLO,You shall reap the rewards of your insolence!
KIRK,We're tired of your phony fireworks!
APOLLO,"Mortal, you have earned this!"
CAROLYN,"No, don't!"
KIRK,Lieutenant!
CAROLYN,A father doesn't destroy his children. You said you were
KIRK,Lieutenant!
CAROLYN,How can they worship you if you hurt them?
KIRK,Lieutenant.
CAROLYN,"Apollo, please.  You know so much of love."
APOLLO,"I shall be lenient with you, for her sake. You will make plans"
KIRK,"And you will supply the herds of sheep, and the pipes we'll play,"
APOLLO,"You will dismantle your ship for the supplies you need, and"
SCOTT,"Captain, we've got to do something!"
KIRK,We were doing something until our brave lady stepped in and saved
MCCOY,"Any more good ideas, Jim?"
KIRK,"Yes, I have. One more. And it depends on the lieutenant's"
APOLLO,Fools. I offer them more than they could
KIRK,"Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Enterprise, come"
Kirk to SCOTT,Carolyn. What's happened to her?
KIRK,"Scotty, I'll find out."
CHEKOV,Perhaps if I assisted.
KIRK,How old are you?
CHEKOV,"Twenty two, sir."
KIRK,Then I'd better handle it. (goes over to a very satisfied looking
CAROLYN,"Oh, yes, I'm all right. I have a message for you."
KIRK,Come over there. Well?
CAROLYN,He wants us to live in peace. He wants to provide for us.
KIRK,"All right, Lieutenant, you can come down from Mount Olympus now."
CAROLYN,I don't understand.
KIRK,"He thrives on love, worship, attention."
CAROLYN,Yes?
KIRK,"We can't give him that worship, none of us can. Especially you."
CAROLYN,What?
KIRK,Spurn him. Reject him. You must. You're special to him.
CAROLYN,Yes. I love him.
KIRK,"Lieutenant. All our lives, here and on the ship, depend on you."
CAROLYN,"No, not on me."
KIRK,"On you, Lieutenant! Reject him, and we have a chance to save"
CAROLYN,"Oh, but you don't understand. He's kind, and he wants the best"
KIRK,Give me your hand. Your hand.  Now feel that. Human
CAROLYN,"Yes. Yes, I understand. He's calling me."
KIRK,Lieutenant. You have your orders and your duty.
CAROLYN,"Yes, sir. My orders and my duty."
UHURA,"I think we can try it now, sir. Enterprise"
KIRK,Kirk here.
SPOCK,"Spock here, Captain."
SPOCK,Is there a structure of some sort near you?
KIRK,"There is indeed, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Very good. How are you doing on the force field?
SPOCK,"We can negate sections of it, creating"
KIRK,"Well, that ought to do it. Have Sulu lock all"
SPOCK,Captain. I would recommend a discreet
KIRK,"If that structure is the source of his power,"
KIRK,"Bones, do you think that mysterious organ in"
MCCOY,"Well, it doesn't serve any other purpose I know of."
SCOTT,"Captain, we've got to wait until Carolyn comes back before we"
KIRK,"Yes, I know. I know. Scotty. We'll wait."
CAROLYN,"I must say, Apollo, the way you ape human behaviour is"
APOLLO,My what?
CAROLYN,I'm sure they're unique. I've never encountered a specimen
APOLLO,I am Apollo. I've chosen you.
CAROLYN,"I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my"
APOLLO,Your work?

SULU,"Ready, sir."
KIRK,Fire.
SULU,Torpedo away.  Direct hit.
SPOCK,No effect. Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo.
KIRK,"Absorbed it? There must be damage to your instruments, Spock ."
SPOCK,"They are in good working order, Captain."
KIRK,But what could have absorbed that much energy and survived?
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
SULU,"Sir, they've fired another."
KIRK,"Can we take it, Mister Scott?"
SCOTT,"That's problematical, sir."
SPOCK,"Captain, shields are down. We cannot survive another hit."

NOMAD,Non sequitur. Your facts are uncoordinated.
MCCOY,"Jim, I don't think anybody's in there."
NOMAD,I contain no parasitical beings. I am Nomad.
SCOTT,"In my opinion, that's a machine."
SPOCK,It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer.
NOMAD,I am Nomad. What is opinion?
SPOCK,"An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment."
NOMAD,Insufficient response.
SCOTT,What's your source of power?
NOMAD,It has changed since the point of origin. There was much taken
KIRK,Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s?
SPOCK,Yes. It was reported destroyed. There were no more in the

KIRK,I will bring them.
NOMAD,I have the capability of movement within your ship.
KIRK,This way.

SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Spock, Bones, come with us."
SPOCK,"Chart 14A, sir?"
KIRK,"14A.  Nomad,"
NOMAD,Yes.
KIRK,"This is our point of origin, the star we know as Sol."
NOMAD,You are from the third planet?
KIRK,Yes.
NOMAD,A planet with one large natural satellite?
KIRK,Yes.
NOMAD,The planet is called Earth?
KIRK,Yes.
NOMAD,"You are the creator, the Kirk. The sterilisation procedure"
KIRK,What sterilisation procedure?
NOMAD,"You are the Kirk, the creator. You programmed my function."
MCCOY,"Well, I'm not the Kirk. Tell me what your function is."
NOMAD,"This is one of your units, creator?"
KIRK,"Yes, he is."
NOMAD,It functions irrationally.
KIRK,"Sometimes, but tell him your function nevertheless."
NOMAD,"My function is to probe for biological infestations, to destroy"
KIRK,Biological infestation. There was never any probe sent out for

NOMAD,"Not the system, creator Kirk. Only the unstable biological"
MCCOY,Unstable infestation? The population of four planets? What kind
of function KIRK,Doctor. Why do you call me the creator?
NOMAD,Is the usage incorrect?
KIRK,"Well, I"
SPOCK,The usage is correct. The creator was simply testing your memory

NOMAD,For what purpose is singing?
UHURA,I don't know. I like to sing. I felt like music.
NOMAD,What is music?  Think about
SCOTT,Lieutenant! Keep away from that
KIRK,Scotty!
KIRK,Bones.
MCCOY,"He's dead, Jim."
KIRK,Why did you kill him?
NOMAD,The unit touched my screens.
KIRK,That unit was my Chief Engineer.  Lieutenant.
KIRK,Sickbay. What did you do to her?
NOMAD,That unit is defective. Its thinking is chaotic. Absorbing it
SPOCK,That unit is a woman.
NOMAD,A mass of conflicting impulses.
KIRK,Get Scott down below.
NOMAD,Will the creator effect repairs on the unit Scott?
KIRK,He's dead.
NOMAD,Insufficient response.
KIRK,His biological functions have ceased.
NOMAD,Does the creator wish me to repair the unit?
MCCOY,"There's nothing I can do, Jim. If there's a chance, it'll have"
KIRK,"All right, Nomad. Repair the unit."
NOMAD,I require tapes on the structure.
MCCOY,"Well, he'll need tapes on general anatomy, the central nervous"
SPOCK,"Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed"
NOMAD,"Proceed.  Creator, the unit Scott is a"
KIRK,"It serves me as it is, Nomad. Repair it."
NOMAD,Where is the unit Scott now?
MCCOY,The body is in Sickbay.

NOMAD,I am programmed to investigate.
KIRK,I have given you new programming and you will implement it.
NOMAD,There is much to be considered before I return to launch point.
KIRK,Reevaluate?
SPOCK,"I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator. Captain, it"
KIRK,It was a foolish mistake.
SPOCK,"Even worse. Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point,"
KIRK,"Spock, do you think it's possible that it got a fix on Earth when"
SPOCK,I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities.
KIRK,And we've shown it the way home. And when it gets there
SPOCK,It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units.
KIRK,And it will carry out its prime directive. Sterilise.

KIRK,Manual controls.
SPOCK,No response.

MCCOY,I think so. Looks like some kind of shock.
KIRK,What happened?

KIRK,"You're at liberty to do so, Mister Spock."
CHEKOV,"Deck five, sir?"
CHEKOV," So you die,"
MAN,"Your men, Captain. Easy, Farrell. I did your job. Ask the captain."
FARRELL,Sir?
KIRK,"Yes, he did your job."
FARRELL,"Smart boy, switching to the top dog."
KIRK,Get him out of here.
MAN,Mister Chekov was going to make me a chief. You could make me an
KIRK,All right. You're working for me.
MAN,A commission?
KIRK,You're in line. You might even make captain.
MAN,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Not on my ship.
FARRELL,"The booth for this one, sir?"
KIRK,"Yes, the booth. Carry on."
MCCOY,Here. Here. What's this?
KIRK,It's called blood. Watch your step. The officers move up by
SCOTT,"Mister Sulu is Security Chief, like the ancient Gestapo."
MCCOY,And my Sickbay is a chamber of horrors. My assistants were
KIRK,Report on technology.
SCOTT,Mostly variations in instrumentation. Nothing I can't handle.
KIRK,Star readings?
SCOTT,"Everything's exactly where it should be, except us."
KIRK,Let's find out where we stand. Computer.
COMPUTER, Ready.
KIRK,"This is the Captain. Record security research, to be classified"
COMPUTER,Recorded.
KIRK,Produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm. Correlate
COMPUTER,Affirmative.
KIRK,"At such a moment, could persons in each universe, in the act of"
COMPUTER,Affirmative.
KIRK,Could conditions necessary to such an event be created
COMPUTER,Affirmative.
KIRK,"Record procedure. Scotty, can you do it?"
SCOTT,Not by myself. I'll need help. And you'd be too conspicuous.
MCCOY,"I'm a doctor, not an engineer."
SCOTT,Now you're an engineer. I'll have to tap the power we need from
MCCOY,"Jim, the way this ship is run, what kind of people are we in"
KIRK,Let's find out. Computer.
COMPUTER,Ready.
KIRK,Read out official record of current command.
COMPUTER,Captain James T. Kirk succeeded to command ISS Enterprise
KIRK,Cancel. Now we know.
SCOTT,Captain? We can do it.
KIRK,Good.
SCOTT,"We have to lay in the automatic transporter setting, but when we"
KIRK,"I'll tell Uhura to create a diversion to distract Sulu, at your"
MCCOY,"Jim, if we're here, what do you suppose our counterparts doing"
KIRK,On our Enterprise.
SPOCK,"I think not. Your authority on this ship is extremely limited,"
SPOCK,I can answer none of your questions at this time.
SPOCK,Apparently some kind of transposition has taken place. I find it
SPOCK,Fascinating.
SPOCK,"Captain, I am pleased that you frustrated"
KIRK,Why?
SPOCK,I do not desire the captaincy. I much prefer my scientific
KIRK,"Logical, as always, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,The agony booth is a most effective means of discipline. I
KIRK,I haven't decided.
SPOCK,Indeed. His act warrants death.
KIRK,I said I haven't decided.
SPOCK,"That is, of course, your affair. Captain, may I inquire if you"
KIRK,You heard my orders.
SPOCK,"They are, of course, in contradiction to standard Empire"
KIRK,Is that a threat?
SPOCK,"I do not threaten, Captain. I merely state facts. I have found"
KIRK,"Spock, do you think we should destroy the Halkans?"
SPOCK,Terror must be maintained or the Empire is doomed. It is the
KIRK,"Conquest is easy, control is not. We may have bitten off more"
SPOCK,"Captain, I do not wish to find myself opposing you, but if you"
KIRK,"Is my concern, not yours. You would find me a formidable enemy."
SPOCK,"I'm aware of that, Captain. I trust that you are aware of the"
FARRELL,"Orders, sir?"
KIRK,Release Chekov. Confine him to quarters.
FARRELL,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,That ought to hold him for about six hours.
MARLENA,I fell asleep. We had quite a time in the chem lab picking up
KIRK,"He gambled, I won."
MARLENA,You got lucky. I'm surprised you could be caught off-guard
KIRK,I was preoccupied.
MARLENA,You're still in trouble with Starfleet Command. What you've
KIRK,"Further than that, if I'm successful."
MARLENA,"Really? Well, you must know what you're doing. You always do."
KIRK,Kirk here.
SPOCK,"Mister Spock, Captain."
SPOCK,I have received a private communication from Starfleet Command.
KIRK,"Yes, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,I am instructed to wait until planet dawn
KIRK,And if I don't?
SPOCK,"In that event, I am ordered to kill you and"
MARLENA,"Let's drink a toast to Spock, The only man"
KIRK,I don't intend to kill him.
MARLENA,Are you going to act against the Halkans before the deadline?
KIRK,"No, but I'll avoid killing Spock."
MARLENA,"Just get him out of the way, he and his men."
KIRK,I'll get out of his way.
MARLENA,Shall I activate the Tantalus field? You'll at least want to
KIRK,Yes.
MARLENA,I hate this thing.
KIRK,It's not that bad.
MARLENA,Of course not. It made you captain. How many enemies have you
KIRK,"Well, if you don't take advantage of your opportunities"
MARLENA,You don't rise to the command of a starship or even higher.
MARLENA,That magnificent mind of his. But it can't protect him from
MARLENA,You really mean it. It doesn't matter. If Spock fails his
KIRK,I'll see to it that the circumstances of his failure will clear
MARLENA,You're not even afraid of Starfleet Command. Can your scheme
KIRK,How does Marlena want to fit in?
KIRK,Scotty.
SCOTT,"Scotty here, sir."
KIRK,We have to get out of here within three
SCOTT,"We've got another deadline, too, sir."
SCOTT,The two-way matter transmission affected the local field density
KIRK,How fast?
SCOTT,Half hour at the most.
KIRK,If we miss?
SCOTT,You've got to get down there and free the
KIRK,All right. I'll be in the transporter room in ten minutes. I'll
SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,Computer?
COMPUTER,ready.
SPOCK,Explain computer activity in the engineering section.
COMPUTER,A security research is in progress.
SPOCK,Who is conducting the research?
COMPUTER,The Captain and Mister Scott.
SPOCK,What is the nature of the research?
COMPUTER,Programme is classified under voice index log.
SPOCK,"Why are you monitoring my communications, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,My security board has detected extensive use
SULU,He's working on escape or defence.
SPOCK,That is my concern.
SULU,"Correct. It's your play. I hope you succeed,"
SPOCK,"If I am successful, you see yourself a step"
MARLENA,"Oiling my traps, darling. I'm afraid I'm a little out of"
KIRK,"I've never seen perfection, but no woman could come closer to it."
MARLENA,I remember when you used to talk that way.
KIRK,I still do.
MARLENA,Prove it.
KIRK,I've got to go.
MARLENA,"Ship's business? An important task on the crew deck? Well, I"
KIRK,You don't have to do that.
MARLENA,Are you feeling sorry for me? Do I see hesitation in your eyes
KIRK,You could.  I simply meant that you could
MARLENA,It's been a long time since you've kissed me like that. You're
KIRK,You're the Captain's woman until he says you're not.
KIRK,Uhura?
KIRK,Scotty's signal should be coming through any moment. You know
KIRK,Keep Sulu's attention off that board.
KIRK,Good luck. Kirk out.
UHURA,"You aren't very persistent, Mister Sulu. The"
SULU, Now you're making
UHURA,I was getting bored. Of course this isn't the time.
SULU,Any time's a good time.
UHURA,I'm afraid I changed my mind. Again.
SULU,"You take a lot of chances, Lieutenant."
UHURA," So do you, Mister. So do you. Take over for"
UHURA,"Mister Scott, all clear. On my way to"
MCCOY,Now it's up to the captain.
SPOCK,"Please restrict your movements, Captain."
KIRK,"What are you doing? Are you going to shoot me now, Spock? I"
SPOCK,"I shall make that decision. Since your return from the planet,"
KIRK,Shoot. You're wasting time.
SPOCK,"I shall not waste time with you. You're too inflexible, too"
KIRK,"You're running a big risk, Spock."
SPOCK,"I have the phaser, Captain, and I do not intend to simply"
SPOCK,"Yes, of course. The entire landing party."
KIRK,"How much time, Scotty?"
SCOTT,"Hardly fifteen minutes, sir. The field density between the two"
MCCOY,"Help me get him on the table. Well, come on. Help me get him on"
KIRK,"Everything laid in, Scotty? The time lag so the operator can get"
SCOTT,"All laid in, sir. Come on, McCoy! We're taking a chance of not"
MCCOY,We'll get home. This won't take long.
MCCOY,"Do you want me to stop, Jim? It'll only take"
KIRK,"He is very much like our own Mister Spock, isn't he? You've got"
KIRK,"What is this, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,"Mister Spock has orders to kill you, Captain. He will succeed,"
SCOTT,"Captain, we've barely got ten minutes."
KIRK,"Let's go, Bones."
MCCOY,"I can't let him die, Jim. You get on to the transporter room."
KIRK,No longer.
MCCOY,"I guarantee it. Now, go on, please."
SPOCK, Why did the captain let me
SPOCK,"Our minds are merging, Doctor. Our minds are one. I feel what"
KIRK,A friend. Activate the transporter. You saved us back at Sickbay
MARLENA,Take me with you.
KIRK,I can't. I'm sorry. Our power is balanced for four. There's no
SCOTT,"It's working, sir."
MARLENA,But there are only three of you.
KIRK,"One is coming. I'd help you if I could, Marlena. Believe that."
KIRK,"If you kill us, you'll still stay."
KIRK,"Where's McCoy? Time, Scotty."
SCOTT,"Five minutes, sir."
MARLENA,Do you know what they'll do to me?
SCOTT,"The power's cut, sir. They're on to us."
KIRK,Auxiliary.
SCOTT,"Aye, it's available."
KIRK,Can you bridge to your setup?
SCOTT,"I can get us the power, but the automatic setting is linked to"
KIRK,One of us will have to stay.
SCOTT,"I'll stay, Captain."
KIRK,"Get to the transporter chamber. You, too, Uhura."
SCOTT,Jim.
KIRK,"That's an order, Scotty."
SCOTT,"Aye, Captain."
MARLENA,What about me?
KIRK,McCoy.
SPOCK,I cut the transporter power. It was necessary to delay your
SPOCK,"Engineering, re-activate main transporter circuits."
KIRK,"You're a man of integrity in both universes, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,You must return to your universe. I must have my captain back. I
KIRK,In that time I have something to say. How long before the Halkan
SPOCK,Approximately two hundred and forty years.
KIRK,The inevitable outcome?
SPOCK,"The Empire shall be overthrown, of course."
KIRK,"The illogic of waste, Mister Spock. The waste of lives,"
SPOCK,You have one minute and twenty three seconds.
KIRK,"If change is inevitable, predictable, beneficial, doesn't logic"
SPOCK,One man cannot summon the future.
KIRK,But one man can change the present. Be the captain of this
SCOTT,"Captain, get in the chamber!"
KIRK,"What about it, Spock?"
SPOCK,A man must also have the power.
KIRK,In my cabin is a device that will make you invincible.
SPOCK,Indeed?
KIRK,What will it be? Past or future? Tyranny or freedom? It's up to
SPOCK,It is time.
KIRK,"In every revolution, there's one man with a vision."
SPOCK,"Captain Kirk, I shall consider it."
KIRK,Spock.
SPOCK,"Welcome home, Captain."
KIRK,What I don't understand is how were you able
SPOCK,It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like
KIRK,"Probably. However, that Jim Kirk will find a few changes, if I"
MCCOY,"Jim, I think I liked him with a beard better. It gave him"
KIRK,What worries me is the easy way his counterpart fitted into that
SPOCK,"Indeed, gentlemen. May I point out that I had an opportunity to"
KIRK,"I'm not sure, but I think we've been insulted."
MCCOY,I'm sure.
MARLENA,Captain Kirk.
KIRK,"Lieutenant, er, Lieutenant?"
MARLENA,Marlena Moreau. I was just assigned last week.
KIRK,"All right, Lieutenant. Carry on."
SPOCK,"You've met her before, Captain?"
KIRK,"Uh, why do you ask?"
SPOCK,"Your reaction, One of recognition."
KIRK,"Oh, no. No, no. We haven't met before, exactly. She just seemed a"
Original Airdate,"13 Oct, 1967"
KIRK,Start your readings.
MCCOY,"Well, I just might stake out a claim and settle down here, Jim."
KIRK,"It is spectacular, isn't it?"
MCCOY,It's a shame to have to intrude.
KIRK,"Well, the last scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor"
SPOCK,"The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain. Husbandry"
KIRK,Are you sure about that?
SPOCK,"Oh, quite sure. Readings indicate the entire planet is covered"
KIRK,I know. Almost impossible.
CHEKOV,It makes me homesick. Just like Russia.
MCCOY,"More like the Garden of Eden, Ensign."
CHEKOV,"Of course, Doctor. The Garden of Eden was just outside Moscow."
KIRK,Just outside Moscow. All right. There's a village about seventeen
HENDORFF,Captain.
MCCOY,Dead.
KIRK,What did somebody say? That paradise must've looked like this?
KIRK,"As soon as we get out of the way, beam the"
SCOTT,"Aye, Captain. It's a shame about Hendorff."
KIRK,What is it?
SCOTT,We're losing potency in our antimatter pods.
KIRK,What's causing it?
KIRK,But you say there's nothing to worry about?
SCOTT,"Well, sir, I didn't exactly say that."
KIRK,"Well, stay on top of it. We've got a job to"
SCOTT,I hear it's nice down there.
KIRK,"Yeah, it's nice. If we're a little more"
SCOTT,I could do with a nice walk in a garden with
KIRK,"We'll do the walking, Scotty. You get on the"
SPOCK,"I find that most unusual, Captain."
KIRK,Scotty will handle it. We've got a job to do. Turn up anything on
SPOCK,Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions.
KIRK,That's strange.
SPOCK,"Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced."
KIRK,Mallory.
MALLORY,"Yes, Captain?"
KIRK,We're heading for the village. Avoid contact with the humanoids.
MALLORY,"Aye, aye, sir."
SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,What is it?
SPOCK,"There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with"
CHEKOV,"What is it, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"A visitor. One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say."
MARTHA,"All this beauty, and now Mister Hendorff dead, somebody"
CHEKOV,"If you insist on worrying, worry about me. I've been wanting to"
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, Yeoman Landon. I know you find each other"
CHEKOV,I was about to take some readings.
SPOCK,Anything?
KIRK,"Whatever it is, it moves like a cat."
MCCOY,"Jim, I don't like this."
KIRK,"Neither do I. All hands. We've been watched, we'll probably be"
SPOCK,"Interesting. Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite,"
KIRK,"Would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks, Mister"
SPOCK,"Obviously highly unstable, Captain. This could be a find of some"
KIRK,"Garden of Eden, with land mines."
SCOTT,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Kirk here.
SCOTT,"I couldn't stop it, but I know why."
KIRK,Why?
SCOTT,Something from the surface. It's like a pail
KIRK,"We're heading there now, Scotty. You need any help?"
SCOTT,"There's nothing you can do about it, sir."
KIRK,"All right, Scotty. We'll try and find out what's going on down"
SPOCK,"If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may"
KIRK,Some kind of generator?
SPOCK,"If so, an immense one. Probably subterranean."
KIRK,What's that?
MCCOY,Some of the thorns like those that killed Hendorff. See the
KIRK,Peculiar stuff to find in paradise.
SPOCK, Jim!
KIRK,Spock! Spock! Security alert. Is he alive?
MCCOY,I filled him with enough masiform D to make the whole crew turn
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,We're beaming up. Notify transporter room. And make arrangements
SCOTT,"Aye, aye, sir. Transporter room, stand by to"
KIRK,All hands.
SCOTT,"Standing by, sir."
KIRK,Energise.
SCOTT,Energise.
KIRK,"Scotty, energise. Scotty, what's the matter?"
SCOTT,"We can't make transporter contact, sir. The"
KIRK,"Scotty, is the transporter malfunction tied"
SCOTT,"I don't know, sir. I'll check it and get back with you. Scott"
KIRK,Spock. Are you all right?
SPOCK,"Doctor McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions, turning my"
MCCOY,"If your blood were red instead of green, you wouldn't have an"
KIRK,Just what do you think you were trying to do?
SPOCK,"I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I"
KIRK,Stepped in front and took the thorns yourself.
SPOCK,"I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that. It was"
KIRK,"I see. Well next time, just yell. I can step out of the way as"
SPOCK,I shall do so.
KIRK,Trying to get yourself killed. Do you know how much Starfleet has
SPOCK,One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred
KIRK,"Never mind. But thanks. Kaplan, take the post."
KAPLAN,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Not only is something after us, but it's after the ship as well."
SPOCK,"Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require"
KIRK,"Thirty seconds ago, there wasn't a cloud in the sky."
KIRK,Come on!
KIRK,"Phasers. A beautiful day, Mister Spock. Not a cloud in the sky."
KIRK,Kirk here.
MALLORY,"Mallory here, Captain. I'm near the"
KIRK,"Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Come in!"
MALLORY,The village is primitive. Strictly tribal
KIRK,"Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Mallory!"
SPOCK,Captain. Those co-ordinates are a short distance in that
KIRK,On the double.
MALLORY,It's over there! That way! I never saw anything like
KIRK,"Mallory! Marple, stand back! Watch it! The rocks! (kneeling by"
MCCOY,"Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this."
KIRK,His father helped me get into the Academy.
SPOCK,"Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable."
KIRK,I could've prevented all of it.
SPOCK,I don't see how.
KIRK,"A walk in paradise, among the green grass and flowers. We"
SPOCK,You are under orders to investigate this planet and this
KIRK,I also have the option to disregard those orders if I consider
SPOCK,No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly
KIRK,"Marple, Chekov, at attention. Gentlemen, something or someone is"
SPOCK,"Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient!"
CHEKOV,"Mind your own business, sir! For your information, I have a"
SPOCK,"Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice!"
CHEKOV,"What do you want, violence?"
KIRK,I won't hurt you. Do you understand? I won't hurt you.
AKUTA,You struck me. With your hand.
KIRK,"Well, I won't strike you again. You've been following us,"
AKUTA,I am the eyes of Vaal. He must see.
KIRK,Who is Vaal?
AKUTA,Vaal is Vaal. He is everything.
KIRK,Do you have a name?
AKUTA,I am Akuta. I am the leader of the feeders of Vaal.
KIRK,"They're not going to hurt you. I promise you. Akuta, Akuta, we"
AKUTA,Akuta alone speaks to Vaal. I am the eyes and the voice of Vaal.
SPOCK,"Captain, this is fascinating. If you will permit me, sir?"
KIRK,Antennae?
AKUTA,They are my ears for Vaal. They were given to me in the dim time
KIRK,You speak of the people of Vaal. Are they nearby?
AKUTA,We are close to Vaal so we may serve him. I shall take you
SCOTT,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Kirk here.
SCOTT,"Condition red. Condition red. Captain,"
KYLE,"It's no use, Mister Scott. We're just barely"
KIRK,"Scotty, are the warp drives still out?"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. All we have is impulse power."
KIRK,Put it on maximum. Full emergency circuits.
SCOTT,"They're all on, Captain."
SCOTT,Kyle?
KYLE,"No, sir. We're slipping."
SCOTT,"Computer banks, Kyle. Feed in a rate, get me a figure. We might"
SCOTT,We're starting to lose ground. Hurry up on
KIRK,Maintain full reverse thrust against the
SCOTT,"I've done that, Captain. They haven't been"
KIRK,"Scotty, you're my Chief Engineer. You know everything about that"
SCOTT,"I'll do everything there is to do, sir. Scott out."
KIRK,Tell me about Vaal.
AKUTA,All the world knows about Vaal. He causes the rains to fall and
KIRK,Take me to him. I wish to speak to him.
AKUTA,"I shall take you to him, but he will not speak to you. He speaks"
KIRK,I'll take my chances.
AKUTA,Vaal.
SPOCK,Fascinating. A very high order of
KIRK,"But this is not the centre, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"No, Captain. The centre is deep in the earth beneath us. This is"
KIRK,A force field?
SPOCK,Obviously.
KIRK,You all right?
SPOCK,"Yes, quite. It extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all"
KIRK,"Akuta, how do you talk to Vaal?"
AKUTA,Vaal calls me. Only then.
KIRK,"Well, we can't get to it. We can't talk to it unless it wants to"
AKUTA,"Vaal sleeps now. When he is hungry, you may be able to speak"
KIRK,When does he get hungry?
AKUTA,"Soon. Come. We will give you food and drink. If you are tired,"
AKUTA,These are the people of Vaal.
KIRK,Where are the others?
AKUTA,There are no others.
KIRK,The children.
AKUTA,Children? You use unknown words to me.
KIRK,Little ones like yourselves. They grow.
AKUTA,Replacements. None are necessary. They are forbidden by Vaal.
MARTHA,"But when a man and woman fall in love,"
AKUTA,Love. Strange words. Children. Love. What is love?
MARTHA,Love is when two people are
AKUTA,"Ah, yes. The holding, the touching. Vaal has forbidden this."
MCCOY,"Well, there goes paradise."
AKUTA,"These people, are from another place. They have come among us."

SAYANA, Our
KIRK,"Well, thank you. It does something for you."
SPOCK,"Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable."
SAYANA,I am Sayana. You have a name?
SPOCK,Yes. Spock. I am Spock.
SAYANA, Spock?
SPOCK,I fail to see what they find so amusing.
AKUTA,Come!
AKUTA,This house is your house. I will send you
CHEKOV,Now we're welcome. A while ago this whole planet was trying to

KIRK,Do it. Kirk out.

SPOCK,Quite possible. It checks with my atmospheric analysis. Their

KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,"Apparently, our hypothesis is correct. There is no living being"
KIRK,"Well, the field's down, people are going in. Let's see what kind"
KIRK,That's not the way.
SPOCK,"Evidently not. This is no ordinary machine, Captain. It may well"
KIRK,But it needs to eat. Frequently. So it can't have any great power
SPOCK,That may not be of any help. The Enterprise has only ten hours
KIRK,"What happens if Vaal weakens around feeding time? Spock, check"
SPOCK,Acknowledged.
MCCOY,"What's going on, Jim?"
KIRK,Mess call.
SPOCK,"In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity."
MCCOY,It would take a computerised Vulcan mind such as yours to make
SPOCK,"Doctor, you insist on applying human standards to non-human"
MCCOY,"There are certain absolutes, Mister Spock, and one of them is"
SPOCK,Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work
MCCOY,"Jim, you're not just going to stand by and be blinded to what's"
SPOCK,"Doctor, these people are healthy and they are happy. What ever"
MCCOY,"It might work for you, Mister Spock, but it doesn't work for me."
KIRK,"Gentlemen, I think this philosophical argument can wait until our"
SCOTT,"Scotty, sir. We have a reading on the power"

SCOTT,"No, sir. Power's dropping bit by bit."
KIRK,Good. Keep monitoring. How are you coming
SCOTT,We're putting everything but the kitchen
KIRK,"That's cutting it a bit fine, Scotty."
SCOTT,"Aye, but if we don't break out, I'd rather"
KIRK,Kirk out.
MARTHA,Every time I think of the Enterprise
burning up and us KIRK,"Yeoman, you're wasting energy."
MARTHA,"Captain, we're trapped,"
KIRK,"Sit down, and have something to eat."
MARTHA,The Enterprise is up there
KIRK,"That hasn't happened yet. I wonder what would happen? Yeoman,"
MARTHA,But they can't. You said that Vaal takes care of them.
KIRK,Accidents happen.
MARTHA,"Yes, I suppose if someone were to fall off a cliff or"
KIRK,"They'd need a replacement. Opinion, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,I see no alternative.
MARTHA,"But these people, I mean, if they don't know anything about."
KIRK,Mister Spock? You're the science officer. Why don't you explain
SPOCK,"Well, I believe it's safe,  safe to assume that they"

MARTHA,"No, not if you're with me."
SAYANA,Why do you look like that?
MAKORA,The way they touched. I do not understand.
SAYANA,They were not angry. I think it was pleasant for them.
MAKORA,But what is to be gained? It is not a dance. It gathers no
SAYANA,"It is pleasant, Makora."
MAKORA,Yes. They touched in this way.
MAKORA,Vaal! He is angry.
AKUTA,The law is plain. I have given you the words of Vaal. Do you beg

SPOCK,Disturbing. The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared.

KIRK,Bones!
MCCOY,"Second degree burns. Not serious, but I'll bet they smart."
SPOCK,"Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement."
KIRK,Marple!
KIRK,Put them in the hut. Find out where the women are. Put them in

KIRK,"All right, Scotty, put her in full reverse."
SCOTT,"Full reverse, Mister Kyle, all engines."
KYLE,Sir!
SCOTT,"Captain, we're doing it. We're pulling away!"
KIRK,"Scotty, what happened?"
KYLE,"It's no good, sir. There's only a few systems responding."
SCOTT,There's nothing left to try again. I guess
KIRK,You're fired. Four hundred people
MCCOY,Jim
KIRK,They'll die because I couldn't see a warning sign. I had to
CHEKOV,Get back in there.
MCCOY,Fine time to ring the dinner bell.
CHEKOV,Get back in there. Now!
KIRK,"Bones, that's it. Stay with Chekov. Keep those people from"
KIRK,"Scotty, do you still have phaser power?"
SCOTT,"Aye, but what"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir, but they won't penetrate that"
KIRK,"If my guess is correct, they won't have to."
AKUTA,Vaal calls to us. Let us go to him. He
SPOCK,"Readings are getting weaker, Captain. Wide"
KIRK,Tapping its energy cells.
SPOCK,I would assume so.
KIRK,Good. The ship's pulling away must have weakened it considerable.
SPOCK,If it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off a phaser
KIRK,My plan exactly. Scotty.
SCOTT,"Scott here, sir."
KIRK,"Scotty, commence firing and maintain."
SCOTT,"Mister Kyle, all phasers commence firing."
SPOCK,"A tremendous upsurge in generated power, Captain. Obviously Vaal"
KIRK,Good. Let's see how long he can do it.
KIRK,"Scotty, cease fire."
SPOCK,"No power generation at all, Captain. Vaal is dead."
KIRK,"Mister Scott, status report."
SCOTT,Tractor beam gone. Potency returning to

SAYANA,What are children?
KIRK,The little ones? Look like you? Just go on the way you're going.
MCCOY,"I don't agree with you at all, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"That's not unusual, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Jim, I want you to hear this."
SPOCK,"Captain, I'm not at all certain we did the correct thing on"
MCCOY,We put those people back on a normal course of social evolution.
KIRK,"Well, that's a good object lesson, Mister Spock. It's an example"
SPOCK,"Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis."
KIRK,"Yes, of course I'm aware of it. Adam and Eve tasted the apple and"
SPOCK,"Precisely, Captain, and in a manner of speaking, we have given"
KIRK,"Doctor, do I understand him correctly? Are you casting me in the"
SPOCK,"Not at all, Captain."
KIRK,Is there anyone on this ship who even remotely looks like Satan?
SPOCK,"I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain."
KIRK,"No, Mister Spock. I didn't think you would be."
Original Airdate,"20 Oct, 1967"
PALMER,The distress call definitely came from one of the solar systems

KIRK,"Try to raise it, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,"I have it on the sensors, Captain. By configuration, a starship"
PALMER,"No answer, Captain. All I get is the automatic beacon."
SPOCK,Sensors not recording normal energy output.
KIRK,"Approach course, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,It's the Constellation. Look at that.
SPOCK,She may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar
KIRK,She was attacked. Red alert! Red alert! Man your battle stations!
PALMER,Red alert. Red alert. Man your battle stations.
KIRK,Mister Sulu?
SULU,"All phaser banks manned and ready, sir."
KIRK,Very good. Initiate a full sensor scan of the immediate area for

KIRK,"We're going to board her. Mister Spock, you're in command."
SPOCK,Acknowledged.
WASHBURN,Radiation level normal. Atmospheric pressure eleven pounds
CREWMAN,"Filtration systems are out, sir."
SCOTT,"The whole communication system looks to be shorted out, too,"
KIRK,"Scotty, check the phaser banks. See if they've been fired. Bones,"
SCOTT,"Come along, lads."
WASHBURN,What a mess.
KIRK,"No clutter, no half-empty cups of coffee."
WASHBURN,"What do you think did it, sir?"
SCOTT,"I don't know, lad. But I want a full structural and control"
KIRK,"The crew wasn't abducted, they just left."
KIRK,"No survivors, no bodies either."

SCOTT,"Captain, I've checked the engines. The warp drive is a hopeless"
KIRK,Phaser banks?
SCOTT,Exhausted. They didn't give up without a battle.
KIRK,But where are they? I can't imagine a man like Matt Decker

MCCOY,Commodore? Commodore Decker? 
KIRK,Matt? Matt.
DECKER,Kirk. It's Jim Kirk.
KIRK,"What happened to your ship, Matt?"
DECKER,"A ship. Attacked. That, that thing."
KIRK,What thing? What was it?
DECKER,That
KIRK,"Answer me! What was it? What happened, Matt?"
MCCOY,"Jim, give him a minute. He's in a state of shock."

KIRK,Go.
WASHBURN,"We made a complete check on structural and control damage,"
KIRK,"Deactivated? Scotty, could some kind of general energy dampening"
SCOTT,"Aye, that all adds up. But what sort of a thing could do all"
DECKER,"If you'd seen it, you'd know. The whole thing's a weapon. It"
KIRK,What does it look like?
DECKER,"Well, it's miles long, with a maw that could swallow a dozen"
KIRK,"What is it, an alien ship? Or is it alive, or is it"
DECKER,Both or neither. I don't know.
KIRK,"Matt, your log stated that the fourth planet was breaking up. You"
DECKER,"We saw this thing hovering over the planet, slicing out chunks"
KIRK,Did you run a scanner check on it? What kind of a beam?
DECKER,Pure antiproton. Absolutely pure.
KIRK, Kirk here.

KIRK,"Thank you. Stand by, Mister Spock. Kirk out."
MCCOY,"This whole thing's incredible. A robot? A machine like that, who"
KIRK,"We don't know. An alien race, apparently from another galaxy."
MCCOY,But why?
KIRK,"Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine?"
MCCOY,"No. I'm a doctor, not a mechanic."
KIRK,It's a weapon built primarily as a bluff. It's never meant to be

KIRK,Take it easy.
MCCOY,The first thing we're going to do is get you back to the

KIRK,There's no ship to leave. It's a dead hulk! We'll take her in
DECKER,"It's just that I, I, I never lost a command before."
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise. Have the transporter room beam Doctor McCoy
MCCOY,Come on.
SPOCK,"It came up on us fast, Captain, but we seem"
SPOCK,It looks very much like Commodore Decker's planet killer. And it

SCOTT,I can't repair warp drive without a spacedock.
KIRK,"Then get me impulse power. Half-speed, quarter-speed, anything."
SCOTT,"Aye, the impulse engines are still in fair shape. I might coax"
KIRK,Then get moving.
SCOTT,"Come on, lad."
KIRK,"Washburn, you get in there. Let's see what we can do about this"
MCCOY,"No casualties, Mister Spock. How are we"
SPOCK,"We have outrun it, Doctor."
DECKER,Status report.
SPOCK,"Impulse and warp engines operative, transporter and"

DECKER,"Belay that last order, helmsman. One hundred and eighty degree"
SPOCK,"You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu."
DECKER,"Mister Spock, I'm officially notifying you that I'm exercising"
SPOCK,"You have the right to do so, but I would advise against it."
DECKER,That thing must be destroyed.

SPOCK,"Unfortunately, Starfleet Order 104, Section B, leaves me no"
A clearly states MCCOY,To blazes with regulations! You can't let him take command when

MCCOY,I'll certify that right now.
SPOCK,You'll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove
MCCOY,"Now, you know I haven't had time to run an examination on him."
SPOCK,Then your statement would not be considered valid.
DECKER,"You may leave the Bridge, Doctor."
MCCOY,What about the Captain? We can't leave
DECKER,"Doctor, you may leave the Bridge."
MCCOY,"Spock, do something!"
DECKER,"Mister Spock knows his duty under regulations, Doctor. Do you?"
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,Kirk here.
SCOTT,"Captain, the impulse engines' control"
SCOTT,"Aye, we can cross-connect the controls, but it'll make the ship"
KIRK,"You worry about your miracles, Scotty, I'll"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir."

KIRK,Ready to give it a try?
WASHBURN,"Just one minute, sir."

SCOTT,"Controls are all hooked up, sir. We should"
WASHBURN,"Try it now, Captain."
KIRK,"Yes, I think (an image of tiny Enterprise and the giant planet"
DECKER,Fire!
SULU,Direct hit. It just bounced off.
SPOCK,"Commodore, I urgently recommend immediate withdrawal."
DECKER,Recommendation noted. Maintain course. Fire!
KIRK,"Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Enterprise, come"
SCOTT,"Coming, sir. If I push these impulse engines"
KIRK,"Washburn, get down to Engineering. Assist"
WASHBURN,"Aye, sir. "

SPOCK,"That, sir, is illogical. It is suicide. Attempted suicide would"
DECKER,Veer off.
SPOCK,Emergency impulse power.
SULU,We can't break loose!
SULU,We haven't got it. We're being pulled inside.
KIRK,"Scotty, give me that power."
SCOTT,"You've got it, Captain. Just enough to move"
KIRK,"That'll do. Full ahead, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"That's it, Mister Scott. Keep that power coming."
DECKER,Full power astern.
SULU,"Aye, sir. We still can't move."
KIRK,"Keep pouring it on, Scotty."
SCOTT,"Captain, I still don't know what we're"
KIRK,"We're moving, the Enterprise isn't. Maybe"

KIRK,"Mister Scott, it worked. Great. (sees that"

PALMER,"No, sir, but I've got ship-to-ship communications back. Picking"
SPOCK,"On audio, Lieutenant."
DECKER,"Mister Spock, I am still in command. I will speak for this"
KIRK,Matt. What's going on? Give me Mister Spock.
DECKER,"I'm in command here, Jim."
DECKER,Nothing. I assumed command according to regulations

KIRK,Give me Spock.
DECKER,"I told you, I am in command here, according to every rule in"
KIRK,"There's only one thing I want to say to you,"

KIRK,"Take evasive action, Mister Sulu."
DECKER,"I told you, I am in command here and I will"
KIRK,"Mister Spock, relieve Commodore Decker"
DECKER,You can't relieve me and you know it.
KIRK,"Blast regulations! Mister Spock, I order you"
SPOCK,"Commodore Decker, you are relieved of"
DECKER,I don't recognise your authority to relieve me.
SPOCK,"You may file a formal protest with Starfleet Command, assuming"
DECKER,You wouldn't dare.  You're

DECKER,"No. No, I don't suppose that they do. Very well, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Captain, I have assumed command."
Mister Spock SPOCK,"One moment, sir. Commodore. I believe you are scheduled for"
MONTGOMERY,Sir.
SPOCK,You will accompany the commodore to Sickbay.
MONTGOMERY,"Aye, sir. Commodore?"
SPOCK,"Mister Sulu, change course. Seven zero mark two one."
SULU,"Mark twenty one, sir."
SPOCK,"Captain, we are taking an evasive course back to you. We will"
KIRK,Fine. Just make sure you stay ahead of it.

DECKER,Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Decker here.
SPOCK,"Commodore, I must insist that you return to"

KIRK,We're stronger with you than without you!
SPOCK,"He's gone. Constellation, come in, please."
KIRK,Kirk here.
SPOCK,"Sir, may I offer my condolences on the death"
KIRK,It's regrettable that he died for nothing.
SULU,"Mister Spock, sensors indicate a minute drop"
SPOCK,"The drop in power is definite, Captain but negligible. The"
PALMER,"Mister Spock, the transporter is now operational."
SPOCK,"Transporter operational, Captain. Shall we beam you aboard?"
KIRK,Negative.
SPOCK,There's little to be gained by staying aboard the Constellation.
KIRK,Except possibly the destruction of that thing

KIRK,"No. No, I don't intend to die, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Your chances of survival are not promising.
KIRK,"A calculated risk, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Thirty seconds is very slim timing.
KIRK,A chance I'll have to take. Kirk out.
SCOTT,A cranky transporter's a mighty finicky piece of machinery to be

SCOTT,I've linked it in with the impulse control system. (flips a

SCOTT,"Good luck, Captain."
KIRK,Thank you.
SCOTT,What's the matter with that thing?
KYLE,"It's a power drain somewhere, sir. I almost lost you."
SCOTT,It'll never work like this. It's the main junction circuitry.
KYLE,Bridge. Transporter malfunction.
SPOCK,"Transporter is out, Captain. You'll have to"
KIRK,I can't. Power level's dropping too fast.
SULU,He's two thousand miles from the planet
SCOTT,"Bridge, transporter operational, but this jury-rigging won't"
SULU,Fifteen hundred miles and closing.
SPOCK,"Captain, transporter operational, but just barely."
KIRK,Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal.
SULU,One thousand miles and closing.
SPOCK,"Transporter, stand by."
SULU,Five hundred miles and closing.
KIRK,Beam me aboard.
SPOCK,Energise.

KIRK,Enterprise. Kirk here.

UHURA,"Yes, sir."
KYLE,"Ready, sir."
KIRK,Energise.
MCCOY,"What's on, Jim?"
KIRK,"Trouble.  Jackson, where are the others?"
MCCOY,The man is dead.
KIRK,Odd. Our probe data didn't indicate fog.

SPOCK,"No indications of. A moment, Captain. Picking up life form"
MCCOY,Scott and Sulu?
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"What are the ship's sensors reading now, Lieutenant?"
DESALLE,"Report, Mister."
CHEKOV,I am only picking up physical impulses from the three of them.
DESALLE,"Relay, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"Captain, we are only registering on you.  Captain?"
KIRK,"Lieutenant, can you hear me?"
MCCOY,"Whatever this stuff is, it's getting thicker. Suppose that has"
KIRK,I don't know. There has to be some explanation for the fact that
SPOCK,"No change, Captain."
KIRK,Stand-by alert.
MCCOY,"Listen. Now, what do you think that"
KIRK,Quiet.
KIRK,Who are you?
KIRK,Spock. Comment?
SPOCK,"Very bad poetry, Captain."
KIRK,"A more useful comment, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,What we've just seen is not real.
KIRK,That's useful.
SPOCK,"However, on azimuth twenty four, at just over one hundred"
KIRK,That's where we're going.
MCCOY,"That was a pretty real illusion, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,Jim.
SPOCK,"This is the source of the life form readings, Captain. They're"
KIRK,"Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in."
MCCOY,Is this how we lost contact with the first landing party?
KIRK,"What about it, Spock? Does this structure have anything to do"
SPOCK,"I would say not, Captain. There's no indication of anything that"
KIRK,And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors.
SPOCK,Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside.
KIRK,Could it be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into
MCCOY,"Then it would affect Spock's tricorder too, wouldn't it?"
MCCOY,"Three witches, what appears to be a castle and a black cat."
KIRK,If we weren't missing two officers and a third one dead I'd say
SPOCK,"Trick or treat, Captain?"
KIRK,"Yes, Mister Spock. You'd be a natural. I'll explain it to you one"
SPOCK,That would seem to be in order.
KIRK, Bones. Spock.
CHEKOV,"They're gone, Mister DeSalle. The captain"
DESALLE,Check for malfunctions.
CHEKOV,"I did, sir, as soon as it happened."
UHURA,"Mister DeSalle, that's exactly what happened to Mister Scott and"
DESALLE,Nobody just disappears. They may have encountered a magnetic
If you need help CHEKOV,"I can do it, sir. I'm not that green."
DESALLE,"Lieutenant Uhura, continue in your efforts to break through"
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
DESALLE,We know they're down there. I want them found.
KIRK,"Straight ahead, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,The readings would so indicate.
MCCOY,"Dust, cobwebs. Halloween is right."
KIRK,Spock. Are you all right?
SPOCK,"Yes. I am undamaged, Captain."
KIRK,Bones?  Doc?
MCCOY,You were saying something about trick or treat.
KIRK,"Dungeons, curses, skeletons and iron maidens. They're all Earth"
SPOCK,"I do not know, Captain, but these things do exist. They are"
MCCOY,Could this be an Earth parallel development of some sort?
KIRK,None of this parallels any human development. It's more like a

KIRK,"Scotty, Sulu. Scotty. Put down the phaser. Scotty!"
MCCOY,"They appear to be drugged, Jim. Look at their eyes. Hardly blink"
SPOCK,Neither did Jackson just before he collapsed.
KIRK,"These two are alive. Scotty, do you hear me? Sulu, do you know"
MCCOY,They're going to release us.
KOROB,Stop!

KIRK,Who are you? Why did you bring us here?
KOROB,"My name is Korob. And as for bringing you here, it was you who"

KIRK,That cat.
SPOCK,There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their
MCCOY,Familiars?
SPOCK,Demons in animal forms sent by Satan to serve the wizard.
KIRK,Superstition.
SPOCK,"I do not create the legend, Captain. I merely report it."
KOROB,"You are the different one, Mister Spock. You do not think like"
MCCOY,He doesn't know about trick or treat.
KOROB,"I do not understand that reference, therefore it also is of no"
SPOCK,Ingenious.
KOROB,Do be seated.
MCCOY,We're not hungry.
KOROB,But I insist.
KIRK,"All right, Korob. What do you want from us?"
KOROB,"For the moment, merely that you eat and enjoy. Oh, Doctor, do"
KIRK,You'll find us most unco-operative unless you start explaining
KOROB,Hopefully I can change that attitude.
MCCOY,These look real.
KOROB,"They are, I assure you. Diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires."
KIRK,We could manufacture a ton of these on our ship. They mean

SPOCK,"Not entirely, no. Telepathy doesn't imply control and I assure"

KOROB,You forget what we were sent here for.
SYLVIA,"I forget nothing. I'm not a puppet, Korob, like you."
KOROB,You're a traitor.
SYLVIA,You are a fool. We have nothing like this and I like it. To
KOROB,We have a duty to the old ones.
SYLVIA,What do they know of sensations? This is a new world.
KOROB,You're cruel. You torture our specimens.
SYLVIA,"And that, too, is a new sensation. I find it stimulating."
KOROB,You're wrong! You're discarding everything we live by.
SYLVIA,"I live by my own decisions. You're a weak fool, Korob."
KOROB,I have the power.

SYLVIA,Because you have knowledge which I lack. but were our abilities

SYLVIA,"They're like, like feathers in the wind without the transmuter."
KIRK, Transmuter?
SYLVIA,The source. You will learn. I will teach you later. Later.
KIRK,Then it's a device. You do use tools.
SYLVIA,It gives only form. You're teaching me substance.
KIRK,You haven't changed your mind? You won't return home?
SYLVIA,My home is here with you. A billion worlds of sensation to pick
SYLVIA,You are using me. You hold me in your arms and there is no fire

KOROB,We used the transmuter.
KIRK,"Transmuter. Yes, she mentioned that."
KOROB,There's no time to explain now. She means to destroy us all.
SPOCK,Fascinating.
KIRK,Why a cat?
SPOCK,"Racial memories. The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying"
KOROB,I think I can stop her.
KIRK,You'd better let us.  It's out of energy. She
KOROB,It's my problem. She's one of my kind. Come quickly.
KIRK,Do you think you can make it?
SPOCK,"Ready when you are, Captain."
KIRK, Get ready.
KOROB,No! Get back. Get back. Get back! Get back!
KIRK,"Korob, that door won't last."
KOROB,Get back!

SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,Doc.
SPOCK,Jim!
KIRK,"Well, at least we found them."
SPOCK,"Fortuitous, Captain. And now that we have them all together?"
KIRK,"Maybe we do.  Sylvia, I have the transmuter."
SYLVIA,"You're very clever, Captain. More so than I'd imagined. Clever,"
SPOCK,"Don't let her touch the wand, Captain."
SPOCK,Jim!
KIRK,Don't you get tired of these games?
SYLVIA,I've never played games. Give it to me.

NORMAN,"Good morning, sir, Doctor."
SPOCK,Something wrong?
MCCOY,"Yes. There's something odd about that man, and I can't quite"
SPOCK,Perhaps you're making a rather hasty judgment. Mister Norman has
MCCOY,"I know when something doesn't strike me right, and he doesn't."
SPOCK,"Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments."
MCCOY,"All right. There's something wrong about a man who never smiles,"
SPOCK,I see.
MCCOY,"Spock, I mean that it's odd for a non-Vulcan. The ears make all"
SPOCK,I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic.
MCCOY,"Maybe, but you can't evaluate a man by logic alone. Besides, he"
SPOCK,"That's not at all surprising, Doctor. He's probably terrified of"

KIRK,"Yes, Mister Sulu?"

KIRK,Kirk to Security.
KIRK,"Intruder alert, deck eight, auxiliary control."

SULU,"Turning on three oh seven degrees, mark eight. Being executed"
ROWE,Take care of him.

KIRK,Cut power.
SULU,"I can't, sir. All the controls are jammed."
KIRK,"Spock, take over."
NORMAN,"It will not be necessary, Captain."
KIRK,Tell Security we've found the intruder. Do you mind telling me
NORMAN,I am in total control of your ship. I have connected the

SPOCK,"Confirmed, Captain. He's taken out all the override controls. If"
KIRK,Who are you?
NORMAN,I assure you we are no threat to humanity or humanoid life. We

KIRK,An android.
SPOCK,And most sophisticated.

NORMAN,I am not programmed to respond in that area.
SPOCK, He simply appears to have turned
And since we cannot repair the damage he has donewithout destroying the ship KIRK,It seems we're going to take a little trip.
NORMAN,Captain Kirk. The following individuals
KIRK,Any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the Enterprise.
NORMAN,"If you do not come with me, your engines will be destroyed and"
KIRK,I must say that's a gracious invitation.
NORMAN,"There is a word. Among us there is no corresponding meaning,"
KIRK,And what is that word?
NORMAN,Please.
NORMAN,"Our planet's surface is what you classify as K-type, adaptable"
KIRK,I don't believe it.
MUDD,"Welcome aboard, Kirk. It's been a long time, eh?"
KIRK,Harry Mudd.
MUDD,"Well, to be absolutely accurate, laddybuck, you should refer to"
KIRK,"Ruler? Harry, I want control of my ship returned immediately. We"
MUDD,"Well, I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem there."
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
MUDD,Alice.

CHEKOV,"You know this man, Captain?"
KIRK,"Oh, do I know him. Harcourt Fenton Mudd, thief"
MUDD,Come now.
KIRK,Swindler and con man
MUDD,Entrepreneur.
KIRK,Liar and rogue.
MUDD,Did I leave you with that impression?
KIRK,"He belongs in jail, which is where I thought I left you, Mudd."
MUDD,"And thereby hangs a tale, yes. But look around you, Kirk. Quite a"
KIRK,"Mudd, I want that trained machine of yours, Norman, to deactivate"
MUDD,"I shall do that, Kirk, when I'm ready."
KIRK,I'm telling you now.

MUDD,Merely that you might as well start enjoying yourselves. It's
KIRK,"Harry Mudd, you're a liar and an outlaw and in deep trouble. I"
MUDD,Sorry. That'd be against the law. My law. Decreed by Mudd the
SPOCK,Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant.
MUDD,"I have a fondness for this particular model, Mister Spock, which"
KIRK,"All right, Harry, explain. How did you get here? We left you in"
MUDD,"Yes, well, I organised a technical information service bringing"
KIRK,Did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents?
MUDD,"Well, actually, Kirk, as a defender of the free enterprise"
SPOCK,He did not pay royalties.
MUDD,"Knowledge, sir, should be free to all."
KIRK,Who caught you?
MUDD,"That, sir, is an outrageous assumption."
KIRK,Yes. Who caught you?
MUDD,I sold the Denebians all the rights to a Vulcan fuel synthesiser.
KIRK,And the Denebians contacted the Vulcans.
MUDD,How'd you know?
KIRK,That's what I would have done.
MUDD,It's typical police mentality. They've got no sense of humour.
MCCOY,"Oh, I find that shocking."
MUDD,Worse than that. Do know what the penalty for fraud is on Deneb
SPOCK,"The guilty party has his choice. Death by electrocution, death"
MUDD,"The key word in your entire peroration, Mister Spock, was, death."
KIRK,He broke jail.
MUDD,I borrowed transportation.
KIRK,He stole a spaceship.
MUDD,The patrol reacted in a hostile manner.
KIRK,They fired at him.

SPOCK,Then I'm unable to discern your problem.
MUDD,They won't let me go. They want to study me. They want to learn
KIRK,They picked a fine representative.
MUDD,"Watch your tongue, lad. You're talking about Mudd the First."
KIRK,"I think not, Harry."
MUDD,"You misunderstand me, lad. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you."
NORMAN and ALICES,"Yes, my Lord Mudd."
ALICE,"This way, please."
MCCOY," Harry, what's this?"
MUDD,"Ah. That, gentlemen, is a shrine to the memory of my beloved"
KIRK,Who?
MUDD,"Stella, my wife."
MCCOY,Dead?
MUDD,"Oh, no, no, no. Merely deserted. You see, gentlemen, behind every"
MCCOY,That's very interesting. You leave your wife and then bring her

STELLA,"Nothing, thing, thing,"
MUDD,"Marvellous, isn't it? I finally have the last word with her, and"
NORMAN,You'll find this quite comfortable. Your quarters are down the
If there is anything you need KIRK,Yes. My ship.
KIRK,"Norman, who created you?"
NORMAN,The makers designed us. They came from the galaxy of Andromeda.
MCCOY,Then your makers weren't humanoid?
NORMAN,"They were, as you say, quite humanoid, but, unlike your"
KIRK,What became of them?
NORMAN,Our home planet's sun became a nova. Only a few exploratory
KIRK,Then some of your makers survive.
NORMAN,"No, Captain. They died over the stretch of time."
SPOCK,Whom do you serve now?
ALL,We serve Harry Mudd.
NORMAN,We lacked it for a long time. 
BOTH,You are free to visit them.
KIRK,"All right. We might later. In the meantime, would you mind"
BOTH,Why should we leave you?
KIRK,Because we don't like you. Now. 
KIRK,"Well, opinions?"
CHEKOV,I think we're in a lot of trouble.
KIRK,"That's a great help, Mister Chekov. Bones?"
MCCOY,I think Mister Chekov's right. We are in a lot of trouble.
KIRK,Spock. And if you say we're in a lot of trouble.
SPOCK,"We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the"
KIRK,"Try and find it. The rest of you, look around, learn everything"
NORMAN,"I trust you are enjoying yourself, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Very interesting. Very interesting. This is a most unusual
NORMAN,It is our central control complex.

SPOCK,This would seem to be a simple relay centre. Are all of you
NORMAN, I am not programmed to respond in

KIRK,Very impressive.
UHURA,I should say so.
KIRK,"I must say, I like the styling."
MUDD,"They were, of course, made to my personal specifications, as"
KIRK,"Don't you believe in male androids, Harry?"
MUDD,"Male? Well, I suppose they have their uses."
UHURA,How long does a body like that last?
UHURA,Five hundred thousand years?
MUDD,Immortality and eternal beauty.
SPOCK,"Captain, I've just had a most fascinating"
MUDD,"I'm so glad you enjoyed it, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Jim, you should see the research facilities. They've got a lab"
MUDD,I do so admire a man who devotes himself to knowledge.
KIRK,"Don't lose your head, Bones. Nobody's staying anywhere."
MUDD,"Stubborn, Kirk. Stubborn."
MCCOY,"I wouldn't be bored, I can tell you that."
SCOTT,Let go of me! Now what are you doing? What kind of a woman
ALICE,"The last one, lord."
MUDD,"Splendid. Splendid. Welcome to Mudd, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,"Harry Mudd! Oh, you bogus frat, you. You're the cause of all"
KIRK,"Scotty, you were ordered to stay aboard."
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. And I stayed until that female gargantua threw me into"
KIRK,"What does she mean, the last one?"
MUDD,"Didn't I tell you, Kirk? I beamed a few dozen androids up to your"
KIRK,Are you out of your mind?  You can't

MUDD,"Well, who's to stop me?"
KIRK,Starfleet.
MUDD,"But now, Captain, now I have a ship of my own as fast as any in"
KIRK,I'm trying not to.
MUDD,Alice.
SPOCK,"He could successfully accomplish it, Captain. I've questioned a"
KIRK,"Yes, I know. That's what worries me. How will my crew react in a"
ALICES,"You desire something, lord?"
CHEKOV,"Oh, yes, thank you.  You're Alice"
CHEKOV,And you're Alice
CHEKOV,"Oh, well, it doesn't make much difference. You're both lovely."
ALICES,"Thank you, my lord."
CHEKOV,What a shame you're not real.
CHEKOV,"Oh, I mean real girls."
CHEKOV,You are?
ALICES,"Yes, my lord."
CHEKOV,Harry Mudd programmed you?
ALICES,"Yes, my lord."
CHEKOV,"That unprincipled, evil-minded, lecherous kulak Harry Mudd"
ALICES,"Yes, my lord."
CHEKOV,This place is even better than Leningrad.
SCOTT,"Absolutely fantastic. Hand-worked to the finest tolerances,"
NORMAN,"You may command us to make anything for you, or do the work"
SCOTT,"Captain, you should see this shop! Why, they have facilities"
KIRK,"Is that the way you're going to do it, Mudd? Hit my people at"
NORMAN,"We only wish to make you happy and comfortable, Captain. If we"
KIRK,"All right, here we are, birds in a gilded"
CHEKOV,"I don't know, sir, but it's a very nice gilded cage."
UHURA,"And it is a very pleasant place, Captain."
SCOTT,"What did they offer you, Uhura?"
UHURA,"Oh, nothing really important. Just immortality."
KIRK,"All right. We're getting back to the ship, and don't you forget"
KIRK,No. Yes. My ship.
I am not programmed ALICE and KIRK,To respond in that area.
KIRK,"Yes, I know."
KIRK,"Alice, give us back our ship to please us. Return us to our ship"
KIRK,But we're unhappy here.
SPOCK,Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants
KIRK,We want the Enterprise.
KIRK,"No, it's a beautiful lady, and we love her."
KIRK,Interesting.
SPOCK,Fascinating.
KIRK,"Bones, have you had time to take any psychological readings of"
MCCOY,"I did. And you can forget it. They're perfect, flawless,"
KIRK,"Yes. That's what this crew needs, a little sense of purpose."
KIRK,"Mudd, a few questions I want to ask you."
MUDD,Afraid I won't have time to answer them. My bags are all packed.
KIRK,Yes. My ship.
MUDD,"You're a stubborn fellow, aren't you? But I don't mind. I don't"
STELLA,"Harcourt Fenton Mudd, where have you been? What have you been"
nothing MUDD,Shut up!
STELLA,"Thing, thing, thing."
MUDD,"Alice Number 2, my little love. Will you have my bags transported"
ANDROIDS,"No, my Lord Mudd."
MUDD,What?
NORMAN,"We can no longer take your orders, Harry Mudd."
MUDD,Why not?
NORMAN,Our makers were wise. They programmed us to serve.
MUDD,"Yes, but that's what I'm saying. Put my bags on the ship."
KIRK,"Harry, I think they have something else in mind."
NORMAN,"You are correct, Captain. Harry Mudd is flawed, even for a"
KIRK,"We prefer to help ourselves. We make mistakes, but we're human."
NORMAN,"We will not harm you, but we will take the starship, and you"
MUDD,"Now, look here. You can't do that! Now, listen. To serve us, you"
ANDROIDS,"No, my Lord Mudd."
MUDD,"Alice number One, obey me. Put my bags on that ship!"
NORMAN,We cannot allow any race as greedy and corruptible as yours to

NORMAN,We shall serve them. Their kind will be eager to accept our
NORMAN,We shall take care of them.
SPOCK,Eminently practical.
KIRK,The whole galaxy controlled by your kind?
NORMAN,"Yes, Captain. And we shall serve them and you will be happy,"
KIRK,So far this thing has had its amusing
SPOCK,"Indeed, it is not. They may quite possibly be able to accomplish"
MUDD,"Take my word for it, they can."
SPOCK,"Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste. They"
MCCOY,How do you know so much?
SPOCK,I asked them.
MCCOY,Oh.
KIRK,Why shouldn't they answer our questions? They don't think we can
MUDD,"You're so smart, Kirk, you and this pointy-eared thinking machine"
MCCOY,You wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself.
MUDD,"Oh, yes."
KIRK,"All right, what have we got to work with?"
SCOTT,"Well, Captain, androids and robots, they're just not capable of"
SPOCK,Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is
KIRK,I agree. What in your opinion does direct them?

KIRK,"Nothing, Harry. Just go to sleep."
MUDD,"What do you mean?  Oh, now, now wait a"

KIRK,"Uhura, why did you tell her?"
UHURA,Because I want an android body. I want immortality. I'll live
UHURA,Thank you.
KIRK,Uhura. Beautiful!
UHURA,I half believed it myself.
CHEKOV,"What's next, Captain?"
KIRK,"Next, we take the Alices on a trip through Wonderland."
KIRK,Yes. Your attention.
KIRK,They're celebrating.
KIRK,Their captivity. Do you enjoy the music?
CHEKOV,"Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, lovely lady. You dance"
UHURA,"Thank you, kind sir. "
KIRK,She likes him. Mister Chekov. The floor is no place for an
CHEKOV,"Yes, Captain. "
KIRK,"That's better, Mister Chekov."
KIRK,Your statement is illogical.
SCOTT,How does it look?
MCCOY,Completely inner directed. Oblivious to everything.
KIRK,Good. I wonder how Spock's doing.
SPOCK,Of course. Your computations would
SPOCK,Thank you.
SPOCK,"I love you. However, I hate you."
SPOCK,"Yes, of course. That is exactly why I hate you. Because you are"
SPOCK,Fascinating.
MCCOY,"All right, it's worked so far, but we're not"
KIRK,Well?
SPOCK,"Success, Captain. We've been pruning the leaves and branches of"
KIRK,"If Norman is the control centre, he should be in a bind by what"
SPOCK,Affirmative.
ALL,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,Acknowledged.
NORMAN,What are you doing here?
KIRK,I want you to surrender.
NORMAN,That is illogical. We can move more quickly than you. We are
KIRK,"No, we are stronger. I'll prove it to you. Can you harm a man"
NORMAN,No.
MUDD,"But you already have, Norman, laddy. Human beings do not survive"
MCCOY, You offer us only well-being.
SCOTT, Food and drink and happiness mean nothing to us.
MCCOY,"Suffering, in torment and pain. Labouring without end."
SCOTT,Dying and crying and lamenting over our burdens.
BOTH,Only this way can we be happy.
NORMAN,That is contradictory. It is not logical. Mister Spock.
KIRK,Why not?
SPOCK,Logic is a little tweeting bird chirping in a meadow. Logic is a
SCOTT, I canna go
SCOTT,"Goodbye, cruel universe."
MCCOY,He's dead.
NORMAN,You cannot have killed him. You have no weapons.
KIRK,Scotty. Scotty's dead. He had too much happiness. But now he's
KIRK,"What is a man but that lofty spirit, that sense of enterprise,"
MUDD,"Brilliant! Bravo, bravo, Captain!"
KIRK,How did you like it?
NORMAN,That is irrational. Illogical. Dreams are not real.
KIRK,Our logic is to be illogical. That is our advantage. Mister
SPOCK,"Very well, Captain."
SCOTT,Explosive! 
MUDD,Don't panic. Women and children first.
SPOCK,"I believe that is the correct amount, Captain. Mister Mudd, are"
MUDD,"Aye, aye! "
SPOCK,Be careful. I would not want you to drop it.
MCCOY,"Easy now. Oh, he's caught it!"
KIRK,Watch it! Watch it!
MUDD, Detonator. Fuse. Primer. Mashie.
NORMAN,There is no explosive.
KIRK,No? Observe. Fore!  Boom!
KIRK,Are you all right?
NORMAN,But there was no explosion.
MUDD,I lied.
NORMAN,What?
KIRK,He lied. Everything Harry tells you is a lie. Remember that.
MUDD,"Listen to this carefully, Norman. I am lying."
NORMAN,"You say you are lying, but if everything you say is a lie then"
NORMAN,You are human. Only humans can explain their behaviour. Please
KIRK,I am not programmed to respond in that area.
SPOCK,"I believe they are all immobilised, Captain."
KIRK,Good.
MUDD,"Kirk, old man, I'm beginning to develop considerable respect for"
KIRK,"Why, thank you."
MUDD,Would you consider entering a partnership arrangement with me?
KIRK,A partnership arrangement? You and me?
MUDD,Yes.
KIRK,I've got something else in mind. Let's go.
MCCOY,"Well, you must be very unhappy, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"That is a human emotion, Doctor, with which I am totally"
MCCOY,"Well, we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours."
SPOCK,"Which I find eminently satisfactory, Doctor, for nowhere am I so"
KIRK,"Touché, Bones."
MUDD,"Kirk, now what's this I hear about my having to stay here?"
KIRK,"Yes, Mudd, you've been paroled to the android population of this"
SPOCK,The androids are being reprogrammed. Their original purpose was
MUDD,"But what do I do? Kirk, I'm no scientist."
KIRK,"No, you're an irritant. You'll stay here and provide a"
MUDD,How long?
KIRK,"As long as you continue to be an irritant, Harry. It's up to you."
MUDD,"I suppose that taking everything into consideration, as it were,"
KIRK,"Yes, you are. Oh, there's one more thing, Harry. We've programmed"
MUDD,"I call that unexpectedly civil of you, Captain."
KIRK,Yes.
MUDD,Shut up!
STELLA,"You miserable, conniving toad!"
MUDD,"I order you. Shut up, Stella!"
MUDD,"Kirk, you can't do this."
MUDD,It's inhuman.
MUDD,"No. Number five hundred? No, no, no."
MUDD, Kirk. It's inhuman. Mercy.
KIRK,"Goodbye, Harry. Have fun."
UnknownOriginal Airdate,"10 Nov, 1967"
SPOCK,"We have reached projected point three, Captain. Adjust to new"
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
MCCOY, Jim.
KIRK,"How is she, Doc?"
MCCOY,No change.
NANCY,Small thanks to the Starfleet.
MCCOY,"Now really, Commissioner, you can't blame the Starfleet."
NANCY,I should've received the proper inoculations ahead of time.
MCCOY,Sakuro's disease is extremely rare. The chances of anyone
NANCY,"I was sent to Epsilon Canaris Three to prevent a war, Doctor."
KIRK,"Commissioner, I can assure you that once we reach the Enterprise,"
NANCY,"How soon will we rendezvous with that ship of yours, Captain?"
KIRK,"In exactly four hours, twenty one minutes, Commissioner."
SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,Yes?
SPOCK,"Will you check your automatic scanner, please?"
KIRK,That's odd. I've never seen anything like that before.
SPOCK,Nor have I.
SPOCK,Heading directly toward us at warp speed.
KIRK,"Staying right with us. Sensor readings, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Vaguely like a cloud of ionised hydrogen, but with strong"
KIRK,We've got it.
SPOCK,"Helm does not answer, Captain."
KIRK,Neither do the pods. Communications are dead. Building overload.
SPOCK,"Cut, Captain."
NANCY,What's happening? I demand to know.
KIRK,"You already know as much as we do, Miss Hedford. Whatever that"
SPOCK,"Now on course nine eight mark one two, heading directly toward"
MCCOY,"Jim, we've got to get Miss Hedford to the Enterprise. Her"
KIRK,"I know, Bones, but there's nothing I can do about it."
NANCY,I insist you make your scheduled rendezvous with the Enterprise.
KIRK,"Miss Hedford, we'll do what we can, when we can. At the moment,"
KIRK,"Enterprise, this is the Galileo. Come in, please, come in."
MCCOY,"Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. Some krypton, argon, neon."
KIRK,Spock?
SPOCK,Gravity is similar to Earth. Most unusual in view of its size.
KIRK,"All right, we get out and get up. Issue phasers. Bones, maintain"
NANCY,"Just how long am I supposed to stay inside, Captain?"
KIRK,That's a very good question. I wish I could answer it. All right.
KIRK,"Take a look around, Bones."
SPOCK,"Most unusual. Unlikely. In fact, Captain, I would say quite"
KIRK,Nothing wrong and nothing works.
SPOCK,Precisely.
KIRK,There must be a reason.
SPOCK,Obviously.
KIRK,Let's look a little further.
MCCOY,"Jim, I just took a tricording sweep, and I got the same readings"
SPOCK,The ionised cloud.
MCCOY,"I think so, only it reads here on the surface with us. It's in"
SPOCK,Fascinating.
KIRK,"Bones, get a physiological reading on that, whatever it is."
COCHRANE,"Hello! Are you real? I mean, I'm not imagining you, am I?"
KIRK,We're real enough.
COCHRANE,You speak English. Earth people?
KIRK,From the Federation.
COCHRANE,"The F? Well, it doesn't matter. I'm Cochrane. I've been"
KIRK,"I'm Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise."
COCHRANE,"You're a Vulcan, aren't you?"
SPOCK,Correct.
KIRK,Chief Surgeon Leonard McCoy.
COCHRANE,Doctor.
MCCOY,Pleasure.
KIRK,"Oh, and excuse me, Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford."
COCHRANE,"Ma'am. You're food to a starving man. All of you. Hey, that's"
MCCOY,"He's human, Jim. Everything checks out perfectly."
KIRK,Mister Cochrane. We were forced off our course and taken here by
SPOCK,Which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment.
COCHRANE,"Well, I wouldn't know anything about that."
SPOCK,You say we'll be unable to get the ship to function again?
COCHRANE,Not a chance. There's some sort of dampening field down here.
SPOCK,You don't mind if we continue to try?
COCHRANE,Go right ahead. You've got plenty of time.
KIRK,"What about you, Cochrane? How did you get here?"
COCHRANE,"Marooned, I told you. Look, we'll have lots of time to learn"
NANCY,How perceptive of you to notice I needed one.
KIRK,"If you don't mind, Mister Cochrane, I'd like more than just a"
COCHRANE,"That's right. That's why I'm so glad to see you. Look, I'll"
KIRK,"Yes, she is. And you've been out of circulation quite a while."
MCCOY,"Talks a lot, but he doesn't say much."
KIRK,I've noticed something else.
MCCOY,What's that?
KIRK,He looks familiar.
MCCOY,"Familiar? Now that you mention it, he does."
KIRK,"I can't quite place him, but. What about Miss Hedford?"
MCCOY,"No temperature yet, but we've got to get under way soon, Jim. I"
KIRK,Take Cochrane up on his offer.
SPOCK,"You built this, Mister Cochrane?"
COCHRANE,Yes. I had tools and supplies left over from my crash.
SPOCK,Not bad.
COCHRANE,"Not Earth, but it's livable. I grow vegetables in the fields"
KIRK,"All the comforts of home indeed, Mister"
COCHRANE,You mean my instruments? I imagine things have changed a lot
KIRK,Not that much.
NANCY,Must you keep it so terribly hot in here?
COCHRANE,The temperature's a constant seventy two degrees. Let me get
MCCOY,Do you feel hot?
NANCY,"I feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged."
MCCOY,It was quite a hike here. You're tired. Just take it easy for a
NANCY,"I'll rest later, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Temperature, Captain. First sign."
KIRK,"Yes, I know. It means we're running out of time."
SPOCK,"Captain, Doctor."
KIRK,What was that?
COCHRANE,"Well, sometimes the light plays tricks on you. You'd be"
SPOCK,"We imagined nothing, Mister Cochrane. There was an entity out"
COCHRANE,There's nothing to explain.
NANCY,Thank you.
KIRK,You'll find I have a very low tolerance level where the safety of
COCHRANE,All right. It was the Companion.
KIRK,The what?
COCHRANE,"That's what I call it. As a matter of fact, Captain, I didn't"
SPOCK,You were injured?
COCHRANE,"I was dying, Mister Spock."
KIRK,You seem perfectly all right now. What was the matter?
COCHRANE,I was an old man.
KIRK,You were what?
COCHRANE,"Well, I don't know how it did it, but the Companion"
SPOCK,"I prefer to reserve judgment on that part of your story, sir."
COCHRANE,"I told you, I don't know what it is. It exists, it lives, and"
MCCOY,That's a pretty far out story.
KIRK,"Mister Cochrane, do you have a first name?"
COCHRANE,Zefram.
KIRK,"Zefram Cochrane of Alpha Centuri, the discoverer of the space"
COCHRANE,"That's right, Captain."
MCCOY,But that's impossible. Zefram Cochrane died a hundred and fifty
SPOCK,The name of Zefram Cochrane is revered throughout the known
KIRK,"Isn't your story a little improbable, Mister Cochrane?"
COCHRANE,"No, it's true. I was eighty seven years old when I came here."
KIRK,You say this Companion found you and rejuvenated you? What were
COCHRANE,"I was tired, Captain. I was going to die, and I wanted to die"
SPOCK,"True, his body was never found."
COCHRANE,"You're looking at it, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"If so, you wear your age very well."
MCCOY,How do you feel?
NANCY,Terrible. How should I feel?
MCCOY,You're running a little temperature. Perhaps you should lie
NANCY,"Doctor, will you please just leave me alone. It's the heat."
MCCOY,"All right. Try to relax. Jim, it's started, the fever. It's over"
KIRK,How long do we have?
MCCOY,"A matter of hours, that's all."
KIRK,"Mister Cochrane, you say you were brought here a hundred and"
COCHRANE,I haven't aged. The Companion sees to that.
SPOCK,"Captain. These instruments, they date from the time indicated."
COCHRANE,"I cannibalised it. The food, water, gardens, everything else"
KIRK,You say you can communicate with it. Perhaps you can find out
COCHRANE,I already know.
KIRK,You wouldn't mind telling us?
COCHRANE,You won't like it.
KIRK,I already don't like it.
COCHRANE,You're here to keep me company.
KIRK,You mean you brought us here?
COCHRANE,"No, the Companion did. I told it I'd die of loneliness. I"
NANCY,"No! No! No! That's disgusting! We're not animals! No! Oh, no!"
KIRK,"Spock, run additional tricorder readings. Learn anything you can."
SPOCK,You ask me to find a weapon. Do you intend to destroy it?
KIRK,I intend to do whatever's necessary to get us off this planet and
SPOCK,"Quite clear, Captain."
KIRK,"Very well. You have your orders.  Mister Cochrane,"
COCHRANE,"I'd begin to age again, normally."
KIRK,Do you want to leave here?
COCHRANE,"Believe me, Captain, immortality consists largely of boredom."
KIRK,We're on a thousand planets and spreading out. We cross fantastic
COCHRANE,How would you like to sleep for a hundred and fifty years and
KIRK,"It's all out there waiting for you, but we'll need your help to"
COCHRANE,You've got it.
KIRK,You seem to think this Companion of yours can
COCHRANE,I said it was very powerful.
KIRK,Could it cure her?
COCHRANE,I don't know.
KIRK,How do you communicate with it?
COCHRANE,"It's on a non-verbal level, but I usually get my message"
KIRK,We've got to try. We're helpless. See if it can do something.
KIRK,How do you do it?
COCHRANE,I just sort of clear my mind and it comes.
KIRK,"Bones, what do you make of that?"
MCCOY,"Almost a symbiosis of some kind, a sort of joining."
KIRK,Exactly what I think. Not exactly like a pet owner speaking to a
MCCOY,"No, it's more than that."
KIRK,Agreed. More like love.
MCCOY,Are you all right?
COCHRANE,"Yes. It kind of drains me a little, but I'm all right."
KIRK,Well?
COCHRANE,The Companion can't do anything to help Miss Hedford.
KIRK,Then she'll die.
COCHRANE,"If there's anything I could do to help, I would, and I will,"
MCCOY,Spock! Are you all right?
SPOCK,"Yes. Quite all right, Doctor. A most fascinating thing happened."
MCCOY,It attacked you?
SPOCK,"Evidently. Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is"
MCCOY,"Oh, yes. I'm not a scientist or a physicist, Mister Spock, but"
SPOCK,"Quite correct, Doctor."
SPOCK,"Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch,"
KIRK,"It troubles you, Cochrane?"
COCHRANE,The Companion saved my life. It's taken care of me all these
KIRK,It's also keeping you prisoner.
COCHRANE,I don't want it killed.
SPOCK,We may simply render it powerless.
COCHRANE,But you don't know. You could kill it. I won't stand for
KIRK,"We're getting out of here, Cochrane. Face up to it. I'll do"
COCHRANE,"I suppose from your point of view, you're right."
MCCOY,"We understand how you feel, Mister Cochrane, but it has to be"
COCHRANE,All right. You want me to contact it?
KIRK,Please. Outside.
COCHRANE,What was it they used to call it? The Judas goat? 
SPOCK,"There is some risk, Captain. We do not know the extent of its"
KIRK,Nor it ours.
KIRK,Now.
MCCOY,"Stop it! You're killing them! Stop it, please! Stop it! You're"
MCCOY,"You all right, Jim?"
KIRK,Yeah.
MCCOY,Spock?
SPOCK,All right.
KIRK,"Cochrane got it off of us, but I don't know whether he did us a"
MCCOY,What kind of talk is that?
KIRK,How do you fight a thing like that? I've got a ship up there
MCCOY,It isn't your fault.
KIRK,"I'm in command, Bones. It makes it my fault. How do you fight a"
MCCOY,Maybe you're a soldier so often that you forget you're also
KIRK,Spock.
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain?"
KIRK,"The universal translator on the shuttlecraft. We can try that,"
SPOCK,The translator is for use with more congruent life forms.
KIRK,"Adjust it, change it. The trouble with immortality is it's"
SPOCK,It is possible. If I could widen its pattern of reception
KIRK,"Right down your alley, Spock. Get it here and get to work. That"
KIRK,Any change?
MCCOY,"Yes, for the worse."

SCOTT,The shuttlecraft was on schedule until it was shy five hours of

SCOTT,It didn't wreck. There was no debris. There's no trace of

SCOTT,"We stay on this course, see what comes up."
UHURA,"It's a big galaxy, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,Aye.
COCHRANE,What's the theory behind this device?
KIRK,There are certain universal ideas and concepts common to all
SPOCK,Then it translates its findings into English.
COCHRANE,You mean it speaks?
KIRK,With a voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on
SPOCK,"Quite ready, Captain."
KIRK,"Mister Cochrane, call the Companion."
KIRK,Companion.  We wish to talk to you.
COMPANION,"How can we communicate? My thoughts, you are hearing them."
KIRK,Feminine. No doubt about it.
SPOCK,Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation.
KIRK,I'm way ahead of you.
SPOCK,Then it is not a zookeeper.
KIRK,No. A lover. Companion. It is wrong to keep us here against our
COMPANION,"A man needs the company of his own kind, or he will cease to"
KIRK,One of us will cease to exist if we don't get her to a place
COMPANION,The man needs others of his species. That is why you are
KIRK,"Companion, try to understand. It is the nature of our species to"
COMPANION,Your bodies have stopped their peculiar degeneration. There
SPOCK,This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge. Ask it
KIRK,This isn't a classroom. I'm trying to get us out of here.
SPOCK,A chance like this may never come again. It could tell us so
KIRK,"This isn't the time. Companion, what you offer us is not"
COMPANION,Your impulses are illogical. This communication is useless.
COCHRANE,"Captain, why did you build that"
KIRK,We didn't.
COCHRANE,But I heard
KIRK,"The idea of male and female are universal constants, Cochrane."
COCHRANE,I don't understand.
MCCOY,You don't? A blind man could see it with a cane. You're not a

SPOCK,Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different
COCHRANE,"Do you know what you're saying? For all these years, I've let"
KIRK,What are you complaining about? It kept you alive.
COCHRANE,That thing fed on me. It used me. It's disgusting.
MCCOY,There's nothing disgusting about it. It's just another life
COCHRANE,You're as bad as it is.
SPOCK,Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical. Your
COCHRANE,Is this what the future holds? Men who have no notion of
SPOCK,Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude.
NANCY,Doctor. Doctor.
MCCOY,"Right here, Miss Hedford."

SCOTT,"That's right, Lieutenant. Thousands. And we'll look them over"
KIRK,"Companion, do you love the man?"
COMPANION,I do not understand.
KIRK,"Is he important to you, more important than anything? Is he as"
COMPANION,He is part of me. The man must continue.
KIRK,He will not continue. He will cease to exist. By your feeling for
COMPANION,He does not age. He remains forever.
KIRK,"You speak of his body. I speak of his spirit. Companion, inside"
COMPANION,I do not understand.
KIRK,Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome.
COMPANION,You are wrong. The man is the centre of all things. I care
KIRK,But you can't really love him. You haven't the slightest
COMPANION,If I were human there can be love? 
MCCOY,"What did you hope to gain by that, Jim?"
KIRK,Try to convince her of the hopelessness of it. Love sometimes
SPOCK,"But she or it is inhuman, Captain. You cannot expect her to"
KIRK,I tried.
COCHRANE,It's useless. I know.
NANCY, Zefram Cochrane.
KIRK,Bones?
MCCOY,I don't understand it. She's not sick at all.
NANCY,We understand.
COCHRANE,It's her.
KIRK,What?
COCHRANE,Don't you understand? It's the Companion.
KIRK,Bones?
MCCOY,"She's perfectly healthy. Heart like a hammer, respiration"
NANCY,We are here.
KIRK,We?
NANCY,Both of us. Those you knew as the Commissioner and the
SPOCK,"Companion, you do not have the power to create life."
NANCY,That is for the Maker of all things.
SPOCK,Commissioner Hedford was dying.
NANCY,"That part of us was too weak to hold on. In a moment, there"
SPOCK,"Then you are both here, in the one body?"
NANCY,We are one.
NANCY,"Zefram, we frighten you. We've never frightened you before."
KIRK,"Spock, check out the shuttlecraft. Engine, communications,"
NANCY,"That will not be necessary, Captain. Your vehicle will operate"
COCHRANE,You're letting us go?
NANCY,We could do nothing now to stop you. You said we would not know
COCHRANE,You're very beautiful.
NANCY,Part of me understands. Part does not. But it pleases me.
COCHRANE,I could explain many things.
NANCY,"Oh, let me walk, Zefram. Let me feel the earth against my feet."
KIRK,"Go ahead, Cochrane We have a few things to do."
UHURA,"Mister Scott, it's the Captain."
SCOTT,"Put him on. Lock on to his co-ordinates. Captain, this is"
KIRK,Perfectly all right. Can you get a fix on us.
SCOTT,"The helm is computing your position now,"
SULU,Course two twenty four mark twelve. ETA fifty seven minutes.

SPOCK,"Not coming from a human being. You are, after all, essentially"
KIRK,"Think it over, Mister Cochrane. There's a whole galaxy out there"
COCHRANE,I have honours enough.
SPOCK,"But you will age, both of you. There will be no immortality."
COCHRANE,That's been happening to men and women for a long time. I've
KIRK,Are you sure?
COCHRANE,There's plenty of water here. The climate's good for growing
KIRK,All the best.
COCHRANE,"Captain, don't tell them about me."
KIRK,"Not a word, Mister Cochrane."
MCCOY,"Jim, what about that war on Epsilon Canaris Three?"
KIRK,"Well, I'm sure the Federation can find another woman somewhere"

MCCOY,That hurts worse than the uniform.
KIRK,Captain James Kirk.

KIRK,"My First Officer, Commander Spock."
SPOCK,Vulcan honours us with your presence. We come to serve.
SAREK,"Your service honours us, Captain."
KIRK,Thank you. Chief Medical Officer Doctor McCoy.

SAREK,"I'd prefer another guide, Captain."
KIRK,"As you wish, Ambassador. Mister Spock, we'll leave orbit in two"
SPOCK,"Captain, Ambassador Sarek and his wife are my parents."
KIRK,This is the engineering section. There are a number of emergency
AMANDA,"After all these years among humans, you still haven't learned"
SPOCK,Humans smile with so little provocation.
AMANDA,"And you haven't come to see us in four years, either."
SPOCK,The situation between my father and myself has not changed.
SAREK,"My wife, attend."
KIRK,"Mister Spock. A moment, if you please."
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain?"
KIRK,Explain the computer components.
SAREK,"I gave Spock his first instruction in computers, Captain. He"
SPOCK,"If you will excuse me, Captain. "
KIRK,"I'm sorry, Ambassador. I did not mean to offend. I thought that"
SAREK,Offence is a human emotion. I'm returning to my quarters.
KIRK,"Mrs. Sarek, I just don't understand."
AMANDA,Amanda. I'm afraid you couldn't pronounce the Vulcan name.
KIRK,Can you?
AMANDA,"After a fashion, and after many years of practice. Shall we"
KIRK,It sounded more like a command.
AMANDA,Of course. He's a Vulcan. I'm his wife.
KIRK,And Spock is his son.
AMANDA,"You don't understand the Vulcan way, Captain. It's logical."
KIRK,"Spock is my best officer, and my friend."
AMANDA,I'm glad he has such a friend. It hasn't been easy on Spock.
KIRK,I take it that Spock disagreed with his father on a choice of
AMANDA,My husband has nothing against Starfleet. But Vulcans believe
KIRK,Starfleet force is used only as a last resort. We're an
AMANDA,"Perhaps. But Sarek wanted Spock to follow his teachings, as"
KIRK,They are both stubborn.
AMANDA,"A human trait, Captain?"
KIRK,Excuse me. Kirk here.
KIRK,Source?
KIRK,Go to alert status four. Begin long-range scanning. Kirk out.
MCCOY,"Mister Ambassador, I understand you had retired before this"
SAREK,"One hundred two point four three seven precisely, Doctor,"
KIRK,Ambassador.
GAV," Sarek of Vulcan, do you vote to"
SAREK,"The vote will not be taken here, Ambassador Gav. My government's"
GAV,"No! You! How do you vote, Sarek of Vulcan?"
SHRAS," Why must you know, Tellarite?"
GAV,"In council, his vote carries others. I will know where he stands"
SAREK,Tellarites do not argue for reasons. They simply argue.
GAV,No. You
KIRK,Gentlemen. Ambassador Sarek is quite correct when he points out
SAREK,"You are correct, Captain. Quite logical."
SHRAS,"My apologies, Captain."
GAV,You will excuse me. 
SHRAS,"Have you met Gav before, Ambassador?"
SAREK,We debated during my last council session. Ambassador.
AMANDA,Ambassador Gav lost.
MCCOY,"Spock, I've always suspected that you were a little more human"
AMANDA,"Well, he, he did have a pet sehlat he was very fond of."
MCCOY,Sehlat?
AMANDA,It's sort of a fat teddy bear.
MCCOY,A teddy bear?
SAREK,"Excuse me, Doctor. It has been a rather long day for my wife."
KIRK,Ambassador.
MCCOY,A teddy bear.
SPOCK,"Not precisely, Doctor. On Vulcan, the teddy bears are alive, and"
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,On my way. All duty personnel on Yellow Alert. Don't alarm the
KIRK,Report.
CHEKOV,"A small ship, Captain. It's been there five minutes, remaining"
KIRK,"Identification, Spock?"
SPOCK,"Sensors indicate the size of a scout ship, but the configuration"
KIRK,Does she answer a hail?
UHURA,I've tried all frequencies and hooked in the universal
SPOCK,Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except
KIRK,Care to guess what she is?
SPOCK,"Guess, Captain? I shall need more data for my estimate."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, plot course to intercept that vessel. I want to"
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
SAREK,You embarrassed Spock this evening. Not even
AMANDA,He's also human.
SAREK,He's a Starfleet officer.
AMANDA,I thought you didn't approve of Starfleet.
SAREK,It is not a question of approval. The fact exists. He is in
AMANDA,"Sarek, you're proud of him, aren't you? You're showing almost"
SAREK,It does not require pride to ask that Spock be given the respect
AMANDA,"Not really, but it doesn't matter. I love you anyway. I know."
SPOCK,"Vessel changing course, heading toward us at"
KIRK,Ready main phasers.
CHEKOV,"Phasers armed and ready, sir."
SPOCK,Interesting. They were travelling at approximately warp ten.
KIRK,"Back on original course, Mister Chekov. Report on intruder's"
UHURA,"Captain, Starfleet acknowledges report on our situation and"
CHEKOV,"Back on original heading, Captain. The intruder changed course"
KIRK,"Well, we have a shadow. Faster, more manoeuvrable and"
GAV,"Vulcan, I would speak to you."
SAREK,It does seem unavoidable.
GAV,How do you vote on the Coridan admission?
SAREK,"You seem unwilling to wait for the council meeting, Ambassador."
GAV,You favour? Why?
SAREK,"Under Federation law, Coridan can be protected and its wealth"
GAV,That's well for you. Vulcan has no mining interest.
SAREK,"Coridan has nearly unlimited wealth of dilithium crystals, but"
GAV,Illegal? You accuse us?
SAREK,Some of your ships have been carrying Coridan dilithium
GAV,You call us thieves?
KIRK,Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Whatever arguments you have between
SAREK,"Of course, Captain."
GAV,"Understood. There will be payment for your slander, Sarek."
SAREK,Threats are illogical. And payment is usually expensive.
JOSEPH,Security to Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,How was he killed?
MCCOY,His neck was broken. By an expert.
KIRK,Explain.
MCCOY,"Well, from the nature and location of the break, I'd say the"
KIRK,Who aboard would have that knowledge?
SPOCK,"Vulcans. On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya. It was"
KIRK,"Spock. A short time ago, I broke up an argument between Gav and"
SPOCK,"Indeed, Captain? Interesting."
MCCOY,"Interesting? Spock, do you realise that makes your father the"
SPOCK,Vulcans do not approve of violence.
KIRK,You're saying he couldn't have done it?
SPOCK,"No, Captain. I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill"
KIRK,"But if he had a reason, could he have done it?"
SPOCK,"If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing."
KIRK,"Mrs. Sarek, I'm sorry to disturb you. I must"
AMANDA,He's been gone for some time. It's his habit to meditate in
SAREK,"You want something of me, Captain?"
KIRK,"Ambassador, the Tellarite. Gav has been murdered."
MCCOY,"His neck was broken, Mister Ambassador, by what Spock describes"
SAREK,Indeed? Interesting.
KIRK,"Yes. Ambassador, where were you during the past hour?"
AMANDA,"Captain, you're not accusing him?"
SPOCK,"Mother. If only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical"
SAREK,I quite agree.
KIRK,Then where were you during the hour?
SAREK,"In private meditation, Captain. Spock will tell you that such"
KIRK,"That's a very convenient excuse, Ambassador."
AMANDA,Sarek. Sarek. What's wrong?
MCCOY,"It's difficult to say with Vulcan physiology, but I believe it's"
KIRK,Can you help him?
MCCOY,I don't know that yet either.
KIRK,Spock?
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain. I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the"
KIRK,I'm sorry about your father.
SPOCK,"Yes, it could adversely affect our mission."
KIRK,Aren't you worried about him?
SPOCK,"Worry is a human emotion, Captain. I accept what has happened."
KIRK,"I see. Well, the Romulans have nothing like it. Certainly not the"
SPOCK,I think it unlikely it is one of theirs.
KIRK,"Who, then?"
UHURA,Captain? I picked up the last part of a transmission. Just like
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, directional locator indicates source bearing"
CHEKOV,"It's the intruder ship, sir."
KIRK,"Switch recorder to Mister Spock's station for decode, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"Sir, the directional locator indicates reception point somewhere"
KIRK,A personal receiver? Somebody on board is in contact with that
SPOCK,"Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission."
KIRK,Why not?
SPOCK,It is in no known code. There's no detectable pattern. No
KIRK,Are any conclusions possible from the information?
SPOCK,"Only negative. It fits none of our computer records, and it is"
KIRK,"Murder? Someone out there playing tag? Lieutenant, you've got"
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"If that alien vessel starts transmitting again, I want to know"
KIRK,"Bones, how is he?"
MCCOY,"As far as I can tell from instrument readings, our prime suspect"
AMANDA,No.
SAREK,Yes. There were three others. My physician prescribed
AMANDA,Why didn't you tell me?
SAREK,There was nothing you could have done.
KIRK,"Ambassador, when did you have these attacks?"
SAREK,"Two before we left Vulcan, the third a few hours ago. I was on"
KIRK,There were no witnesses?
SAREK,None.
SPOCK,"Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect?"
MCCOY,"I'm not sure. It's tough enough on a human. On a Vulcan, an"
KIRK,Why?
SAREK,Because of the construction of the Vulcan heart.
SPOCK,I suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the
SAREK,"Yes, unquestionably."
KIRK,"Bones, what about it?"
MCCOY,"Well, I'm glad somebody's asking me something around here. Well,"
CHAPEL,Doctor?
MCCOY,Yes.
CHAPEL,I've checked the blood bank. There isn't enough Vulcan blood
KIRK,There are other Vulcans aboard.
SAREK,"My blood type is T-negative. Somewhat rare, even for a Vulcan."
MCCOY,"Yes, I'd say that's rare."
SPOCK,"My blood is T-negative, Doctor."
CHAPEL,We've run a number of blood tests on Mister Spock. It isn't
SPOCK,It should be possible to filter out the human factors.
MCCOY,"Even you couldn't give that much blood, Spock. It would kill"
KIRK,Bones.
MCCOY,"Mrs. Sarek, you must understand the chances are extremely small"
SPOCK,Indeed. I would estimate the odds
AMANDA,Please don't.
SPOCK,Doctor.
MCCOY,"I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian."
SPOCK,Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan.
MCCOY,Similar is not good enough. It's still experimental.
SPOCK,But it does look promising.
MCCOY,"Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that, even if"
SPOCK,"I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable."
MCCOY,"Plus the fact I've never operated on a Vulcan before. Oh, I've"
AMANDA,"What drug, Doctor? My husband is asleep. What drug?"
MCCOY,A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of

MCCOY,It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver. In

CHAPEL,"Already pulled. You're perfectly healthy, Mister Spock."
MCCOY,What has that got
AMANDA,You're going to use it on yourself. A transfusion from you to
SPOCK,It would seem the only answer.
MCCOY,"It could damage you internally. It could kill you. I'm sorry,"
AMANDA,And I refuse to permit it. I won't risk both of you.
SPOCK,"Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death. And you, Doctor,"
KIRK,Bridge. Spock.
SPOCK,Spock here.
KIRK,"I'm on deck five, near my quarters. I've been"
MCCOY,It's a bad wound. Punctured left lung. A

CHAPEL," Doctor, the K2 factor is dropping."
MCCOY,"Spock, your father is much worse. There's no longer a choice. I"
SPOCK,"No, Doctor."
MCCOY,What?
SPOCK,My first responsibility is to the ship. Our passengers' safety
MCCOY,You can turn command over to Scotty.
SPOCK,"On what grounds, Doctor? Command requirements do not recognise"
SHRAS,"He is Thelev, a minor member of my staff. I"
SPOCK,He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and
SHRAS,"My people are a violent race, but we've no quarrel with Captain"
SPOCK,Apparently Thelev did.
SHRAS,You suggest a plot. How could it profit us to harm the captain?
SPOCK,I do not know. There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the
SHRAS,Perhaps you should forget logic and devote yourself to
SPOCK,Come in.
AMANDA,"Spock, you must turn command over to somebody else."
SPOCK,"Mother, when I was commissioned, I took an oath to carry out"
AMANDA,Any competent officer can command this ship. Only you can give
SPOCK,Any competent officer can command this ship under normal
AMANDA,Duty? Your duty is to your father.
SPOCK,"I know, but this must take precedence. If I could give the"
AMANDA,"Well, I don't. It's not human. That's not a dirty word. You're"
SPOCK,"Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a"
AMANDA,"If this is what it means, I don't want to know."
SPOCK,"It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical"
AMANDA,Nothing is as important as your father's life.
SPOCK,"Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree, if"
AMANDA,"When you were five years old and came home stiff-lipped,"
SPOCK,Mother
AMANDA,"Oh, go to him. Now. Please."
SPOCK,I cannot.
CHAPEL,Doctor McCoy?
KIRK,I'd like to get my hands on the guy with the sledgehammer.
CHAPEL,The one who hit you?
KIRK,"No, the one inside my head. How long have I"
MCCOY,Now let that be a lesson to you. Just lie there and be happy
KIRK,How's Sarek?
MCCOY,Not good. If I could only operate.
KIRK,What's stopping you? I thought you were all ready.
MCCOY,"I was. When you became injured, Spock assumed command. He's"
KIRK,"I can't damn him for his loyalty, for doing his duty, but I'm not"
MCCOY,"Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again."
KIRK,"Bones, Sarek will die without that operation, and you can't"
SPOCK,Captain?
KIRK,"I'll take over, Mister Spock. You report to Sickbay with Doctor"
SPOCK,"Captain, are you quite all right?"
MCCOY,"I've certified him physically fit, Mister Spock. Now since I"
have an operation to perform and both of us are required KIRK,"Get out, Spock. Chekov, what's the status of the intruder?"
CHEKOV,"No change, sir. Maintaining its distance."
KIRK,"Any further transmissions, Lieutenant?"
UHURA,"None, sir."
KIRK,Call Mister Scott to the bridge.
CHEKOV,"Captain, the alien vessel is moving closer."
KIRK,Belay that order. I'll stay here.
UHURA,"Captain, I'm picking up the alien signal again, but it's coming"
KIRK,Specific origin?
UHURA,"From the brig, sir."
KIRK,Security? Security to the brig. Search the prisoner immediately.
MCCOY,"Readings, Nurse."
CHAPEL,Mister Spock's blood reproduction rate is up over two hundred
MCCOY,I wish I knew whether that was good or bad. Initiate sterile
CHAPEL,Mister Spock.
MCCOY,Where do you think you're going?
SPOCK,I must see the captain.
MCCOY,My patients don't walk out in the middle of an operation.
SPOCK,The alien ship. I've just realised that if their power
MCCOY,So is your father's life.
KIRK,Kirk here.
CHEKOV,"Captain, the alien ship has changed course and speed. Moving"
KIRK,Bring the prisoner to the bridge. Deflectors on. Red Alert.
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir. Shields on. Phasers manned and ready, sir."
KIRK,"Chekov, take over Spock's scanners."
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Target, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,Moving away. Turning now. He's coming around again.
KIRK,"Fire as he passes, Ensign."
CHEKOV,"A clean miss, sir."
KIRK,"Report on his weaponry, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,"Sensors record standard phasers, sir."
KIRK,"Standard phasers. Good. They may have more speed, but they're not"
UHURA,"Captain, the intercoms are jammed. All the ambassadors are"
KIRK,"Tell them to take a good guess, but clear that board, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,He's coming around again.
MCCOY,"One more like that, and I'm going to lose"
CHEKOV,"Fire control locked into the computers, Captain."
KIRK,"On my order, fire photon torpedoes two, four and six. Widest"
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,Fire.
CHEKOV,"Full spread missed, sir. They're moving too fast for us."
CHAPEL,"Doctor, his heart's stopped."
MCCOY,Cardio-stimulate.
CHAPEL,The systems are off.
MCCOY,Then get me that old portable cardio-stimulator.
MCCOY,Call engineering and have sickbay systems put on priority.
CHEKOV,"Number four shield has buckled, sir."
KIRK,Auxiliary power.
CHEKOV,"Switching over. Shields firming up. Number four is still weak,"
KIRK,Your friends out there are good. They'll have to destroy this
THELEV,"That was intended from the beginning, Captain."
KIRK,You're not Andorian. Who are you?
UHURA,"Damage reports coming in, Captain. Every deck."
KIRK,"Damage control procedures, all decks. That ship out there has"
CHEKOV,Number two shield is gone.
KIRK,"Engineering, this is the Captain. Cut power on port side except"
THELEV,"Find your own answers, Captain. You haven't long to live."
KIRK,"You're a spy, surgically altered to pass as an Andorian. Planted"
THELEV,"Speculation, Captain."
KIRK,"Engineering, cut power on starboard side. Maintain until further"
THELEV,What are you doing?
KIRK,You speculate.
CHEKOV,"We're starting to drift, sir. Shall I hold her on course?"
KIRK,"No. Stand by your phasers, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir. Phasers standing by. He's just hovering out there,"
KIRK,Looking us over. We're dead as far as he knows.
THELEV,You're baiting him. You're trying to lure him in.
CHEKOV,Here he comes. Range decreasing. Speed dropping close to
KIRK,"Hold your fire, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,Phasers locked on target. Range closing. Seventy five thousand
KIRK,Fire.
CHEKOV,Got him!
KIRK,"Secure from general quarters. Lieutenant, open the hailing"
THELEV,"They could not surrender, Captain. They had orders to"
KIRK,"Lieutenant, relay to Starfleet command. Tell them we have a"
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
THELEV,"Only temporarily, Captain. You see, I had orders to"
KIRK,Take him to Sickbay.
THELEV,I seem to have miscalculated.
KIRK,"So did they. Mister Chekov, take over."
KIRK,Bones?
MCCOY,Are you quite through shaking the ship around?
KIRK,"Spock, Sarek how are they?"
MCCOY,"I don't mind telling you, you sure make it difficult for a"
surgeon trying KIRK,Bones!
AMANDA,"Captain, come in."
MCCOY,That pig-headed Vulcan stamina. I couldn't have pulled them
KIRK,Some doctors have all the luck.
SPOCK,"Captain, I believe you'll find the alien"
KIRK,We damaged their ship. They destroyed themselves to avoid
SPOCK,"I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor."
MCCOY,Orion?
SPOCK,Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the
KIRK,But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet?
SAREK,Mutual suspicion and interplanetary war.
KIRK,"Yes, of course. With Orion carefully neutral, they'd clean up"
SPOCK,The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve. It
KIRK,You might have had something else on your mind.
SPOCK,That hardly seems likely.
KIRK,"No, but thank you anyway."
AMANDA,"And you, Sarek. Would you also say thank you to your son?"
SAREK,I don't understand.
AMANDA,For saving your life.
SAREK,Spock acted in the only logical manner open to him. One does not
AMANDA,"Logic, logic! I'm sick to death of logic. Do you want to know"
SPOCK,"Emotional, isn't she?"
SAREK,She has always been that way.
SPOCK,Indeed? Why did you marry her?
SAREK,"At the time, it seemed the logical thing to do."
KIRK,"Bones.  No, no, I'm all right"
MCCOY,"If you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor, you're going"
SPOCK,"Doctor, I'll return to my station now."
MCCOY,"You are at your station, Mister Spock."
KIRK,"Doctor McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this."
SPOCK,"Indeed, Captain. I've never seen him look so happy."
MCCOY,"Shut up.  Shh. Shh!  Well, what do you know?"
Original Airdate,"1 Dec, 1967"
MCCOY,They're quite large. Seven feet tall is not
MCCOY,"In addition, an assortment of swords and knives."
UHURA,"Call from the bridge, Captain."
KIRK,"Yes, Mister Sulu. Report."
KIRK,Very good. Have the transporter room stand by.
SCOTT,"How long were you stationed on the planet, Doctor?"
MCCOY,Only a few months. We found them totally uninterested in medical
KIRK,"Analysis, gentlemen."
SPOCK,"Ordinarily, under these circumstances, I would recommend a"
KIRK,"Yes, but in this case, with the more people we take down, the"
MCCOY,Agreed. Once they've got it into their heads we're showing
KIRK,"Very well. Scotty, you're in command. Bear in mind that the"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. We'll keep on our toes."
MAAB,Halt! You are of the Earth vessel?
KIRK,I'm Captain Kirk.
MCCOY,We come with open hearts and hands.
GRANT,A Klingon!
KIRK,"Grant, no!"
MCCOY,Don't move a muscle.
KRAS,I am unaware of any state of war between our

KRAS,Or is it your policy to kill Klingons on sight?
KIRK,"He was young, and inexperienced."
MCCOY,Does Maab know that the Klingons are our sworn enemies by their

KIRK,Let me call my ship and inform them
KRAS,"To bring down an attack upon their village? It is as I told you,"
MAAB,Will you hand us your weapons?
KIRK,So they keep their word scrupulously. They're unusually honest.
MCCOY,"Yes, I mentioned that."
SPOCK,He also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous.
KIRK,"Dangerous if lied to, if their customs are violated. We lied to"
MCCOY,Because he was drawing a weapon on another of their guests.
KIRK,"Grant looked up, saw a Klingon, made a purely instinctive"
MCCOY,"Look, Jim. I know what it means to you to lose a crewman."
KIRK,"That's only one down, Doctor. There's over four hundred more up"
CHEKOV,Mister Scott. I'm picking up something on

CHEKOV,"It's just at the edge of our sensor range, sir. Hard to get an"
SULU,You think it's a Klingon ship?
SCOTT,"Who else would be playing cat and mouse with a starship? Well,"
KIRK,Bones.
MCCOY,"Yes, Captain?"
KIRK,I shouldn't have chewed you out. I'm sorry.
MCCOY,I understand.
SPOCK,"Inefficient, however. Emotion, Captain."
KIRK,"Yes, you're quite right, Mister Spock. Inefficient and illogical."
MCCOY,You've shown friendship by handing over our weapons. She's

SPOCK,"It would appear, Captain, that he finds you a disappointment."
AKAAR,I am the teer Akaar. I lead the Ten Tribes of Capella.

MAAB,"Their customs are different, Teer."
KRAS,"And different from those of my people, too, Teer. The sight of"
MCCOY,"Let me take this, Jim. What Maab has said is true. Our customs"
MAAB,"Laughter, Teer? Is not the Klingon an honoured guest also?"
AKAAR,It was the Earth people who first bargained for our rocks.
MAAB,Is it not best to have two who bargain for the same goods?
AKAAR,"It is I who speak for the tribe, Maab."
MAAB,"I speak for many, Teer. Hear the words of the Klingon."
KRAS,What do Earth men offer you? What have you obtained from them in
ELEEN,"The Klingon speaks the truth, Akaar."
KIRK,"The Earth Federation offers one other thing, Akaar. Our laws. And"
MAAB,"Good, good. Let the Klingons and the Earthmen offer us amusement."
AKAAR,"The Earth men have different customs, but never have they lied"
MAAB,"There are those of us who won't bargain with Earthmen, Akaar."
AKAAR,"Do you say you will fight me, Maab?"
MAAB,"Let that be your choice, Teer."
KIRK,"We need our communicators, those devices on our belts. If there's"
a Klingon ship somewhere AKAAR,The sky does not interest me. I must consider the words I have

CHEKOV,"The ship's disappeared, sir. Gone out of"
UHURA,"Mister Scott, I'm getting a call from a vessel. It's so faint I"
SCOTT,"Put a booster on it, Lieutenant. Try to pull it in."
UHURA,I've lost it. It sounded like a distress signal from an Earth

KRAS,"I have no quarrel with you, Captain. I wish merely to return to"
KIRK,Type of vessel. Location.
KRAS,"A small scout ship, Captain. We need the mineral, too. I was sent"
MAAB,Release him.  Akaar is dead. I am the teer.
KRAS,Kill them now.
KIRK,"Wait. If you lead these people now, be certain you make the right"
KRAS,Is the new leader of the Ten Tribes afraid? Let me kill him for
KIRK,Or let the Klingon and me fight. It might amuse you.
MAAB,"Perhaps to be a teer is to see in new ways. I begin to like you,"
KRAS,We had an agreement.
MAAB,"That too may change, Klingon."
UHURA,"I have the signal clear now, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,Dierdre? That's a freighter.
UHURA,"Reporting they're under attack. They're running, trying to"
SCOTT,Helm?

SCOTT,Try the captain.
UHURA,"Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Come in, Captain. Enterprise to"
MCCOY,"Captain, careful."
MAAB,You carry a child who would be teer.
ELEEN,I must die.
KIRK,No!
MAAB,No man may touch the wife of a teer.
KRAS,"She was prepared to die, Earthman."
ELEEN,I was proud to obey the laws. Kill him first. He laid hands upon

MCCOY,"Captain, I'm going to fix that woman's arm. They can only kill"
KIRK,"That's a very good idea, Bones."
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain, an excellent idea."
MCCOY,Let me see that arm.
ELEEN,You will not touch me.
KIRK, You said you're prepared to die. Does that
ELEEN,To live is always desirable.
KIRK,All right. Let's go.
MAAB,Klingon. There's nothing to concern you there.
KRAS,"We made an agreement, Maab. I have a right to my weapons."
MAAB, We have them well cared

CHEKOV,It should be on our screens by now.

MCCOY,"Because I'm a doctor, that's how I know."

ELEEN,No!
MCCOY,"Look, I'm a doctor, not an escalator! Spock, give me a hand!"
ELEEN,No! I will allow only your touch.
SCOTT,A vessel doesn't just disappear.
UHURA,"There's nothing, Mister Scott. All channels and frequencies are"
SCOTT,Mister Chekov?
CHEKOV,"Nothing, sir. If it were destroyed, I'd pick up debris readings"
SULU,"It couldn't have run away from us, sir. Not a freighter."
SCOTT,"Mister Chekov, pull the microtape on that distress call. I want"
SCOTT,Did you hear it? They called us by name. Not a general distress
SULU,Wouldn't they normally call for the nearest starship?
SCOTT,How would a freighter know we were ordered into this sector?
SULU,A trap. We were diverted from the planet.
UHURA,Or it could be an authentic distress call.
SCOTT,We'll stay long enough to make certain. Continue search pattern.
SULU,"Yes, sir. Continuing."
KIRK,"Bones, you've got one of those magnesite-nitron tablets in your"
MCCOY,Just a minute. Let me get her on the rock. There you go.
ELEEN,"No, no. Pain is here."
KIRK,"How did you arrange to touch her, Bones, give her a happy pill?"
MCCOY,No a right cross.
KIRK,Never seen that in a medical book.
MCCOY,It's in mine from now on.
ELEEN,"No, no. It's there. The The pain is there."
KIRK,"Vegetation, Captain. Evidently there's water"
KIRK,"Good, but we need weapons just as much as we need water, Spock."
SPOCK,There would seem to be little weapon potential at hand.
KIRK,Follow me.
ELEEN,No! McCoy!
MCCOY,"Easy, easy. I'm here. Now you must want the child!"
ELEEN,"No. Here, child belongs to husband."
MCCOY,So they take all the credit here. Poppycock! Answer me. Do you
ELEEN,"Yes, it's yours."
MCCOY,"No, no. You've got it all wrong."
ELEEN,"Yes, McCoy. It's yours."
MCCOY,"No. Say to yourself, The child is mine. It is mine. It is"
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Kirk to
SPOCK,"Fortunately, this bark has suitable tensile cohesion."
KIRK,You mean it makes a good bowstring.
SPOCK,I believe I said that.
KIRK,"That's more like it. Since the Capellans never developed the bow,"
MCCOY,"No, no, Mister Spock. You place this arm under here to support"
SPOCK,"I would rather, I would rather not. Thank you."
ELEEN,McCoy. Bring our child.
KIRK,Our child?
MCCOY,I'll explain later.
SPOCK,That should prove very interesting.
SULU,"Still negative, Mister Scott. All sweeps."
SCOTT,Mister Chekov?
CHEKOV,Nothing.
SCOTT,"We're turning back. Warp five, Helm."
SULU,"Warp five, sir. On course for Capella Four."
SCOTT,"Warp 6 as soon as she'll take it, Mister Sulu. The captain could"
UHURA,"Mister Scott, another distress call from the USS Carolina."
SCOTT,Ignore it.
UHURA,The Carolina is registered in this sector.
SCOTT,"Ignore it, Lieutenant. Log it as my order, my responsibility."
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
SULU,"Scotty, if it should turn out to be real"
SCOTT,"There's an old, old saying on Earth, Mister Sulu. Fool me once,"
CHEKOV,I know this saying. It was invented in Russia. (he smirks to
MCCOY,Jim! Spock! Jim! Spock!
KIRK,"What happened, Bones?"
MCCOY,My patient spattered me with a rock. She's gone.
SPOCK,The child?
MCCOY,"It's all right. It's in there. I guess I'll forget psychiatry,"
SPOCK,"Virtue is a relative term, Doctor. She'll head straight to the"
MCCOY,I'll go with you.

SULU,"Thirty one minutes, sir."
CHEKOV,"Mister Scott? Sensors picking up a vessel ahead, cutting across"
SCOTT,Sub-light one half.
SULU,"Reversing to sub-light, one half."
CHEKOV,"It's an alien, sir. By configuration a Klingon warship. Taking"
SCOTT,"Mister Sulu, sound battle stations."
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,This is the USS Enterprise calling unidentified Klingon vessel.
SULU,"I have it on the viewscreen now, sir. Still distant. Holding a"
SCOTT,"Drawing a line, daring us to step over it."
SULU,Still closing. The alien's directly in our line of flight.
SCOTT,This is the commander of the USS Enterprise. Identify yourself
SULU,"Phaser banks are ready, sir."
SCOTT,"And we'll go right down their throat, if necessary. Let's see if"
KEEL,Behind the rocks up there.
MAAB,The Earthmen make excellent game. Their cleverness has surprised
KRAS, They must die. That is your law.
MAAB,"We will honour our law, and our word to you, Klingon."
KEEL,Maab.
ELEEN,"The child is dead, Maab. Do as you will with me."
KEEL,The Earthmen?
ELEEN,Dead. I killed them as they slept.
KRAS,"If true, take us to them."
ELEEN,"Do you doubt my word, Klingon? I'm the wife of a teer. I will"
MAAB,It is in order. She is the wife of a teer.  No!
KRAS,"First, we'll verify her story."
MAAB,"Is this what your sworn word means, Klingon?"
KIRK,Spock. Spock!
SPOCK,"Here, Captain. Over here, Captain. (into communicator as Kirk"
KIRK,The cavalry doesn't come over the hill in the nick of time
SPOCK,"If by that you mean we can't expect help from the Enterprise, I"
MAAB,Naam.
KIRK,There's just one thing I want.
SPOCK,The Klingon?
KIRK,One of us must get him.
SPOCK,"Revenge, Captain?"
KIRK,Why not?
KRAS,The next man who raises a weapon destroys all of you. You and
KIRK,Klingon!
ELEEN,"Fight! Are you warriors or children? Maab, I will flee. When the"
ll MAAB," As teer of the Ten Tribes, I give you back"
MAAB,Klingon!
SCOTT,Hold it there. Drop your weapons.
KIRK,"We missed you, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,"Well sir, we had a wee bit of a run-in with a Klingon vessel,"
MCCOY,"No, that's not the way to handle it. Here, like this. Here, take"
SPOCK,"Oochy-woochy coochy-coo, Captain?"
KIRK,"An obscure Earth dialect, Mister Spock. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo."
SPOCK,"Well, at any rate, this should prove interesting."
KIRK,Interesting?
SPOCK,When the woman starts explaining how the new high teer is
SCOTT,"What's that again, Mister Spock?"
KIRK,"We don't actually understand it ourselves, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,Nor does Doctor McCoy.
KIRK,Contact Starfleet. Inform them the Federation
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
SPOCK,The child's regent?
KIRK,"Yes, Eleen. Remarkable young lady."
MCCOY,"Representing the high teer, Leonard James Akaar."
SPOCK,The child was named Leonard James Akaar?
MCCOY,"Has a kind of a ring to it, don't you think, James?"
KIRK,"Yes. I think it's a name destined to go down in galactic history,"
SPOCK,I think you're both going to be insufferably pleased with
KIRK,"Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Ahead warp factor one."
Original Airdate,"8 Dec, 1967"
KIRK,Where is everyone?
MCCOY,Perhaps they weren't expecting us.
SPOCK,"Our arrival was scheduled well in advance, Doctor. The annual"
KIRK,"I had a subspace contact with a Robert Johnson, the leader of"
MCCOY,Did he report anything wrong?
KIRK,"No, yet there was something wrong. I can't pin it down. His"
CHEKOV,Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain!
KIRK,What is it?
CHEKOV,"A man, sir. In there. A dead man."
KIRK,Well?
MCCOY,Exactly what it looks like. Death by natural causes. Old age.
SPOCK,"Quite impossible, Doctor. I ran a personnel check on this"
ROBERT, They've come to pay their respects to Alvin.
KIRK,I'm Captain Kirk of
ROBERT,You'll have to speak louder.
KIRK,I say I'm Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Who are you?
ROBERT,"I'm Robert Johnson. This is my wife, Elaine."
KIRK,How old are you? How old are you?
ROBERT,"I'm, er, let me see. I am twenty nine, and Elaine is"
ELAINE,I'm twenty seven.
KIRK,"Mister Johnson, can you hear me?"
ROBERT,"I can hear you. Not deaf yet, you know. Not yet."
KIRK,Can you tell me what happened?
ROBERT,What happened?
KIRK,Did your instruments show anything?
ROBERT,Elaine was so beautiful. So beautiful. So beautiful.
MCCOY,"He can hear you, Jim, but he doesn't understand. Let's let him"
KIRK," If they seem lucid, I'll be in the briefing room."
KIRK,"Stay seated. Commodore Stocker, I've asked"
STOCKER,"I appreciate that, sir."
KIRK,"Doctor Wallace, as an expert in endocrinology, I'd appreciate you"
WALLACE," Yes, Captain."
KIRK,"Doctor McCoy, would you fill them in?"
MCCOY,"The expedition is suffering from extreme old age, and they're"
KIRK,"What about the atmosphere and environment, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life. The
KIRK,We're close to the neutral Zone between our Federation and the
SPOCK,"I have already begun investigation into that possibility,"
KIRK,Good. I want you all to check out everything in your own
STOCKER,I'm sure you understand that I'm anxious to get to Starbase
KIRK,"Yes, Commodore. We'll do everything we can to make sure you make"
STOCKER,"Thank you, sir."
KIRK,"Doctor, is there something I can do for you?"
WALLACE,"Well, be a little less the cool, efficient Captain and a"
KIRK,How long has it been?
WALLACE,"Six years, four months, and an odd number of days. You mean"
KIRK,"Well, it's been a long time. Things wouldn't change if it started"
WALLACE,"You said it. I didn't. In all those years, I only heard from"
KIRK,"Well, I supposed that you met someone you loved."
WALLACE,I met a man I admired. A great man.
KIRK,And in your field as you. You didn't give up a thing.
WALLACE,No. Just you.
KIRK,I'm on my way.
SULU,"Standard orbit, Captain."
KIRK,Maintain.
SPOCK,"I've rechecked the sensors, Captain. Gamma Hydra Four checks out"
KIRK,What about the comet that astrophysics reported?
SPOCK,We're checking it on it. I've reached no conclusions as yet. The
STOCKER,Captain Kirk?
KIRK,"Yes, Commodore."
STOCKER,Facilities at Starbase Ten are much more complete than those
KIRK,"Thank you. You're anxious to get to the base, but we have a few"
SULU,"You already gave that command, sir."
KIRK,"Oh? Well, follow it."
MCCOY,Lieutenant Galway.
GALWAY," Doctor, may I speak to you for a moment,"
MCCOY,Of course. Go right ahead.
GALWAY,"I know this is going to sound foolish, but I seem to be having"
MCCOY,It's probably nothing important.
GALWAY,I never had trouble before.
MCCOY,"Well, don't worry about it. Perhaps a little hypersonic"
GALWAY,Thank you.
KIRK,"Progress report, Mister Spock."
KIRK,Astronomical section reports that a comet recently passed by.
KIRK,"Oh, yes. Let me know what you come up with. I'll be in the"
MCCOY,"The last one. Robert Johnson. Cause of death, old age."
KIRK,You did what you could.
MCCOY,Which adds up to absolutely nothing.
MCCOY,"All you need are vitamins, but you can come up anyhow."
KIRK,"Bones, I believe you're getting grey."
MCCOY,You take over my job and see what happens to you.
KIRK,I see what you mean.
MCCOY,"What's your problem, Jim?"
KIRK,Shoulder. Just a twinge. Probably muscular strain.
MCCOY,"You're probably right, Doctor. By the way, I don't like how"
KIRK,All right. Reprimand received. Go ahead.
MCCOY,"Jim, I think we better'd run a complete physical on you."
KIRK,"Why? Just muscular strain, isn't it?"
MCCOY,"No, Jim. It's advanced arthritis, and it's spreading."
KIRK,That's impossible.
MCCOY,"I can run it through again, but I'll come up with the same"
KIRK,Scotty!
KIRK,"Report, Bones."
MCCOY,"All of us who went down to the surface, with the exception of"
KIRK,"Spock, could I ask for some figures?"
SPOCK, Based on what Doctor McCoy
KIRK,Total senility?
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain. In a very short time."
KIRK,"What a way to die. All right. I want all the research facilities,"
MCCOY,I'm doing what I can.  You're perfectly healthy.
SPOCK," I must differ with you, Doctor. I'm having"
MCCOY,"I did not say you weren't affected, Mister Spock. You are"
SCOTT,"Captain, can I go back to my station?"
KIRK,You feel up to it?
SCOTT,"Of course I do. I just need a wee bit of rest, that's all."
MCCOY,"You can leave, too, Lieutenant Galway. Lieutenant Galway?"
GALWAY,"What? You spoke to me, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"Yes, I spoke to you. I said that you could leave, too. Now why"
GALWAY,"No. I don't want to sleep. Can't you understand? If I sleep,"
KIRK,"Lieutenant Galway, assume your position. Start your duties."
GALWAY,"Thank you, sir.  What a stupid place to hang a"
KIRK,"She's ten years younger than I am, and she looks,"
MCCOY,"People age normally at different speeds, Jim."
KIRK,Why hasn't he aged?
MCCOY,I don't know.
KIRK,"Well I want to know! Is it his youth, his blood type, his"
MCCOY,"His genes. All right, nurse. Prepare Chekov for another complete"
CHAPEL,"Come along, Ensign. This won't hurt. Much."
CHEKOV,Promises.
WALLACE,"A few years ago on Aldebaran Three, my"
MCCOY,"Then try that, Doctor Wallace. Try anything, but do it quickly."
WALLACE,"Yes, sir. "
KIRK,I'll be on the Bridge. Keep me posted as to Chekov.
KIRK,"I thought you were on your way to the biochemistry lab, Doctor."
WALLACE,We both go in the same direction.
KIRK,So we do.
WALLACE,"Look, we know the problem. We know the progress of the"
KIRK,You sound like my first officer.
WALLACE,No problem is insoluble. Not even ours.
KIRK,That didn't spring from logic.
WALLACE,Our situation doesn't have its roots in logic. The heart is
KIRK,When did you realise that? Today?
WALLACE,What?
KIRK,How much older was your husband than you?
WALLACE,What difference does that make?
KIRK,Answer me.
WALLACE,Twenty six years.
KIRK,That's quite a difference.
WALLACE,"Jim, he was a brilliant man. We were stationed on a lonely"
KIRK,Look at me. Look at me. What do you see?
WALLACE,"I see Captain James Kirk, a man of morality, decency,"
KIRK,And old. And rapidly growing older.
WALLACE,"Jim, please."
KIRK,"What are you offering me, Jan? Love, or a going away present?"
CHEKOV,"Give us some more blood, Chekov. The needle"
SULU,You'll live.
CHEKOV,"Oh, yes. I'll live, but I won't enjoy it."
SULU,"Maintaining standard orbit, Captain."
KIRK,"Increase orbit to twenty thousand perigee, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
ATKINS," Will you sign this, sir?"
KIRK,Yeoman.  You have a reason for being on the
STOCKER,I'd hoped for a few words with you at your convenience.
KIRK,I have very little time.
STOCKER,"If I may say so sir, we have a due date at Starbase Ten."
KIRK,We're going to be late. I don't intend to leave this area until
STOCKER,"Captain, I'm watching four very valuable and one almost"
KIRK,"Yes, yes. If you're so concerned, I'll send a message to Starbase"
SPOCK,"Captain, you sent such a message this morning."
KIRK,Yeoman? Where's that
ATKINS,Sir?
KIRK,Fuel consumption report?
ATKINS,I gave it to you. You signed it.
KIRK,"If I'd signed it, I wouldn't have asked for it, now would l?"
ATKINS,"Your signature, Captain."
SPOCK,"Captain, I believe  Captain."
KIRK,Mister Spock. I was just thinking.
SPOCK,"Yes, sir. Quite understandable."
KIRK,You have something to report?
SPOCK,"Yes, sir. We have the cause of the affliction."
KIRK,What is it?
SPOCK,The orbit of Gamma Hydra Four carried the planet directly
KIRK,"Good, Spock. Well done. Let's get this to Doctor McCoy"
UHURA,"But, Captain, the Romulans have broken Code two. If you remember"
the last bulletin KIRK,Then use Code three.
UHURA,"Yes, sir. Code three."
KIRK,Message. Key to affliction may be comet which passed by Gamma
SPOCK," Quadrant four four eight, sir."
KIRK,Quadrant. All units are to be alerted for complete analysis of
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Oh, Mister Sulu. Increase orbit to twenty thousand mile perigee."
SULU,"You mean another twenty thousand, Captain?"
KIRK,I fail to understand why each one of my commands is being
SPOCK,"Mister Sulu, what is our present position?"
SULU,"Orbiting at twenty thousand, sir."
KIRK,Maintain.
SULU,"Maintaining, sir."
MCCOY,"Radiation? That's as good an answer as any,"
SPOCK,"Possibly, Doctor, because my thinking processes are not as"
MCCOY," Run this through, Doctor."
KIRK,"All right, Bones, I'm going up to the Bridge. Keep me posted."
SPOCK,"I have a question for the doctor.  Doctor, the"
I MCCOY,"Well, I see I'm not going to be making any house calls on you."
SPOCK,I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my
MCCOY,"I'm not a magician, Spock, just an old country doctor."
SPOCK,Yes. As I always suspected. 
WALLACE,"Doctor McCoy, none of our usual radiation therapies will have"
MCCOY,"Well, then we just start over, that's all. We work harder,"
STOCKER,"Spock, can I have a word with you?"
SPOCK,Commodore?
STOCKER,"Mister Spock, a starship can function with a Chief Engineer, a"
SPOCK,I am aware of that.
STOCKER,Please understand me. My admiration for Captain Kirk is
SPOCK,"For what, sir?"
STOCKER,I would like you to take over command of the Enterprise.
SPOCK,"On what grounds, Commodore?"
STOCKER,"On the grounds that the captain, because of his affliction, is"
SPOCK,"Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same"
STOCKER,"Yes, but you're a Vulcan. You have a much greater life span."
SPOCK,"I'm half human, sir. My physical reflexes are down, my mental"
STOCKER,"Well, if you are not, with your Vulcan physique, then"
SPOCK,"Sir, I do have duties to perform."
STOCKER,Mister Spock. I do not like what I'm about to say but
SPOCK,"I resist that suggestion, Commodore."
STOCKER,"It's not a matter of choice. When a captain is unfit,"
SPOCK,"Very well, sir. The hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred"
MCCOY,Now this isn't going to hurt a bit.
CHEKOV,That's what you said the last time.
MCCOY,Did it hurt?
CHEKOV,Yes.
GALWAY,Doctor.
KIRK,Bones.
MCCOY,She's dead. Her metabolism caused her to age more rapidly than
s going to happen to us unless KIRK,"How long have we got, Bones?"
MCCOY,"Oh, a matter of days. Perhaps hours."
SPOCK,Let it read that this competency hearing was
KIRK,Let it also read that I consider it invalid.
STOCKER,"Mister Spock, may I make a statement? I have had to resort to"
SPOCK,"On the contrary, Commodore. As presiding officer and as second"
KIRK,"Yes, I would like to make a statement. I am the captain of this"
SPOCK,"It is quite impossible, Captain. The regulations are quite"
KIRK,"Very kind of you, Spock."
SPOCK,"Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk?"
SULU,"Two years, sir."
SPOCK,"To your knowledge, has he ever had any difficulty making"
SULU,"No, sir."
SPOCK,Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra
SULU,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,"Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order?"
SULU,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,Did he order you to increase orbit?
SULU,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,Did he not several minutes later repeat that order?
KIRK,"He did not. When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. I"
SPOCK,"Mister Sulu, please answer the question."
SULU,"Yes, sir. Captain Kirk repeated his order."
SPOCK,"Thank you, Mister Sulu. Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a"
ATKINS,"Sir, he had more important things on his mind."
SPOCK,"Yeoman, you will simply answer the question."
ATKINS,"I, I guess he forgot he'd signed it."
SPOCK,You guess?
ATKINS,He'd forgot he'd signed it.
SPOCK,"Thank you, Yeoman. You may leave. Lieutenant Uhura. I have here"
UHURA,They are.
SPOCK,And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours?
UHURA,Those of Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which
UHURA,He did.
SPOCK,Using Code two.
UHURA,"Oh, yes, but he changed it to Code three."
SPOCK,After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two.
UHURA,Yes.
SPOCK,"Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy!"
MCCOY," Yes, Spock? What is it?"
SPOCK,"Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a"
MCCOY,I did.
SPOCK,"Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using"
COMPUTER,Working. Subject's physical age based on physiological
KIRK,"No, I'm thirty four. I'm thirty four years old."
STOCKER,"The computer differs with you, Captain."
SPOCK,Doctor McCoy.
MCCOY,Yes.
SPOCK,Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's
MCCOY,"Captain Kirk is suffering from a, a peculiar physical"
SPOCK,Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly?
MCCOY,"Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now"
SPOCK,"Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's"
MCCOY,"It's a blasted machine, Spock! You can't argue with a machine."
SPOCK,"Do you agree with it, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"Yes. Yes, I do, agree. And I am sorry, Jim."
SPOCK,"This board has no further questions. Unless you, Commodore"
STOCKER,"No. I am quite satisfied, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk?"
KIRK,"I am perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence, Mister"
SPOCK,"Captain, I would suggest"
KIRK,"No, no, no. It's all right, Spock. It's all right. There's only"
I refused to leave GammaHydra Two SPOCK,"Gamma Hydra Four, Captain."
KIRK,Yes. A slip of the tongue.
SPOCK,"You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and"
KIRK,So I'm a little confused. Who wouldn't be at a time like this? My
SPOCK,"We have no more questions, Captain."
KIRK,Ask me anything. Anything.
SPOCK,"There'll be no more questions, Captain. If you would leave the"
room so the board can vote KIRK,Good idea. Get this stupid voting over with so I can get back to
STOCKER,"Well, since the senior officers are incapable and I am of flag"
SPOCK,"Sir, you have never commanded a starship."
STOCKER,"What would you have, a junior officer with far less experience"
SPOCK,The danger from the Romulans
STOCKER,"Mister Spock, we have to save these people. Mister Sulu, set a"
SULU,Across the Neutral Zone?
STOCKER,"Immediately, Mister Sulu. All officers are to return to their"
KIRK,Spock?
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain."
KIRK,"So, I've been relieved."
SPOCK,"I'm sorry, Captain."
KIRK,Yes. You should've been a prosecuting attorney.
SPOCK,Regulations require
KIRK,Regulations. Don't give me regulations. You've wanted command all
First little excuse you get SPOCK,"Captain, I have not assumed command."
KIRK,"I hope you're proud of. What do you mean, you've not assumed"
SPOCK,"I suffer the same affliction as you, sir."
KIRK,"If you're not in command, who is?"
SPOCK,Commodore Stocker.
KIRK,Stocker? Are you crazy? He's never had a field command.
SPOCK,Mister Scott was unfit for command. Commodore Stocker is ranking
officer KIRK,No! Don't talk to me about rank! The man's a chair-bound
SPOCK,"I cannot, Captain."
KIRK,Are you refusing a direct order?
SPOCK,"No, sir. Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard"
KIRK,"You traitorous, disloyal, you stab me in the back the first"
KIRK,"Jan, Jan."
WALLACE,"Oh, Jim. I'm sorry. Truly I am."
KIRK,I made a fool of myself in there. I shouldn't have let them
WALLACE,Everybody understood.
KIRK,"But I'm not old, Jan. I'm not. A few muscular aches doesn't make"
WALLACE,"Oh, Jim, will you forgive me? I have work to do."
KIRK,"Jan, you know me. Look at me closely. Tell me. Am I getting old?"
KIRK,What are you doing here?
SPOCK,It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use.
KIRK,Maybe you'd like to relieve Doctor McCoy. What about Chekov?
MCCOY,Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
KIRK,"Bones, there has to be. There has to be. We beamed down together."
SPOCK,"No, not all the time. Captain, he left us for a few moments."
KIRK,"He left us? He left us. He went into the building. Spock,"
SPOCK,"Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember"
KIRK,He was scared! He saw the dead body and he ran out of the
MCCOY,"Yes, yes. Now that could be. Right. Scared. Heart beats faster,"
WALLACE,"Doctor, hyronalin is the specific accepted for all radiation"
MCCOY,"Yes, yes. Now. But before, adrenaline. Highly promising. Early"
SPOCK,"Quite possible, Doctor. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious"
MCCOY,"Don't just stand there jawing, Spock. You and Doctor Wallace get"
SULU,"Entering Romulan Neutral Zone, sir. All"
STOCKER,"Thank you, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, let me know if we"
UHURA,"I think we just made contact, sir."
SULU,"Romulans approaching from both sides. We're bracketed, sir."
UHURA,"Engineering wants instructions, sir."
CHEKOV,"Commodore Stocker, what are your orders? Commodore!"
KIRK,I'm going up to the bridge.
MCCOY,"No, Jim. You can't do it."
KIRK,I have to go to the bridge. We're under attack.
MCCOY,Nurse? Doctor Wallace!
KIRK,Let me go.
MCCOY,Nurse.
WALLACE,Jim.
CHAPEL,"Easy, Captain."
KIRK,We're under attack. I have to go to the Bridge. I've got to go to
STOCKER,Keep trying to raise the Romulans.
UHURA,"I'm trying, Commodore."
STOCKER,"If I could talk to them, explain to them why we violated the"
UHURA,The Romulans are notorious for not listening to explanations.
SULU,"Lieutenant Uhura is right, sir. We've tangled with them before."
KIRK,"Greenhorn, up there ruining my ship."
WALLACE,"Jim, if I have to give you a shot"
MCCOY,"Jim-boy, you just lay quiet. You can't do no good. We're both"
KIRK,No. No. My ship. My ship.
SPOCK,"Doctor, I made the necessary computations and produced this"
MCCOY,"All right. Let's, let's go."
SPOCK,"It could cure or kill, Doctor."
MCCOY,Don't give me any Vulcan details. Just give me the shot.
KIRK,No. I'll take the first shot.
MCCOY,You can't.
KIRK,How long do you think this ship can take the pounding? I've got
WALLACE,"Jim, it could kill you."
KIRK,I'll die anyway. Do it.
SPOCK,"Doctor Wallace, give him the shot."
KIRK,Quickly. Quickly.
SULU,"Sir, they've fired another."
MCCOY,"Well, well, what's happening?"
WALLACE,The ageing process has stopped. His bodily functions are
UHURA,"Sir, I've tried all known hailing"
STOCKER,"Opinion, Mister Sulu."
SULU,They know they have us. They know our shields will give out.
STOCKER,"Well then, we have no alternative but to surrender."
CHEKOV,"Sir, the Romulans do not take captives."
SULU,"We're losing power, sir."
STOCKER,What am I going to do? I've got to do something.
KIRK,"Report, Mister Sulu."

UHURA,"But, Captain, Code"
KIRK,"That's an order, Lieutenant. Code two."
UHURA,"Yes, Captain. Code two."
KIRK,Message. From Enterprise to Starfleet Command this sector. Have

SPOCK,"Romulans giving ground, Captain. Obviously, they tapped in as"
KIRK,"A logical assumption, Mister Spock. Are they still retreating?"
SPOCK,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Good. All hands, stand by. Warp factor eight, now."
SPOCK,"The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain. They're falling"
KIRK,"Are we out of range, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,"Yes, sir. And out of the Neutral Zone."
KIRK,"Secure from Red Alert. Adjust a new course, two five seven"
SULU,"Two five seven degrees, mark three."
STOCKER,"Captain, I just wanted to assure you that I did what I thought"
KIRK,"Noted. You should know, however, that there's very little a"

MCCOY,Feeling fine. So is Scotty. The serum worked. He pulled a muscle

MCCOY,"Oh, very well. A few bruises here and there. Oh. Anytime you're"
SPOCK,"I am quite ready now, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Because of your Vulcan physique, I have prepared an extremely"
SPOCK,"That is very considerate of you, Doctor."
MCCOY,I thought you'd be pleased to hear that.
KIRK,"Well, gentlemen, all and all, an experience we'll remember in our"

KIRK,I thought I said that.
Original Airdate,"15 Dec, 1967"
SPOCK,"Our scanner survey was correct, Captain. There it is. Pure"
KIRK,Fantastic. 20 times as hard as diamond.
SPOCK,"Twenty one point four times as hard, to be exact."
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock.  Scotty, you can mark"
SPOCK,"We won't be able to break it, Captain. I'll phaser off a"
KIRK,Lesley.
KIRK,"Do you smell that? A sweet odour like honey. It was years ago, on"
SPOCK,We're in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet.
KIRK,Rizzo.
RIZZO,"Yes, sir?"
KIRK,Take your men. Make a swing around our perimeter. Scan for

KIRK,Acknowledged. Continue standing by. Kirk out.
SPOCK,"Captain, dikironium exists only in laboratory experiments."
KIRK,It's gone. I could have been wrong. The last time I caught an
RIZZO,"Seemed to read dikironium for a minute, and then I lost it. It's"
RIZZO,Captain?
KIRK,Kirk here.
RIZZO,Captain.
RIZZO,"Cloud, cloud."
KIRK,Fire into it immediately!
KIRK,Spock. Dead. And you'll find every red corpuscle gone from their
SPOCK,"Rizzo's alive, barely."
KIRK,"Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, lock in on us. Medical emergency."
SPOCK,"You think you know what it was, Captain?"
KIRK,"Something that can't possibly exist, but it does."
CHAPEL,"Autopsy report, Doctor."
KIRK,How's Ensign Rizzo?
CHAPEL,"Still unconscious, sir."
MCCOY,Transfusions?
CHAPEL,Continuing as rapidly as possible. His blood count is still
KIRK,Kirk to bridge.
KIRK,Hold your position.
KIRK,Then you'll inform them that we might be a little late.
MCCOY,"Jim, the Yorktown's ship surgeon will want to know how late."
KIRK,"Gentlemen, we are remaining in orbit until I find out more about"
MCCOY,You saw their colour. There wasn't a red corpuscle left in their
KIRK,"Marks, cuts, incisions of any kind?"
MCCOY,Not a one. What happened is medically impossible.
KIRK,I suggest you look at the record tapes of past similar
MCCOY,"Thank you, Captain. I'll check those tapes immediately."
KIRK,"First, can you bring Ensign Rizzo to consciousness for a moment?"
MCCOY,"Yes, but it"
KIRK,Will it hurt him if you do so?
MCCOY,"In his present condition, I don't think it would make much"
KIRK,Then do so.
CHAPEL,"Transfusion completed, sir. His pulse and"
MCCOY,"Give him one cc of cordazine, nurse."
CHAPEL,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Rizzo. This is the captain. Can you hear me? Do you remember what
RIZZO,Remember. I'm cold. I'm so cold.
KIRK,"You were attacked by something. When it happened, did you notice"
RIZZO,Yes. Yes. A smell. A strange smell. It was like being smothered
KIRK,"Did you feel a presence, an intelligence?"
RIZZO,"It was trying to draw strength from us. I felt it. It was, it"
MCCOY,He's beginning to sleep again. I can't risk another shot.
KIRK,He's already told me what I wanted to know.
MCCOY,I wouldn't depend too much what he says in that half-conscious
KIRK,You check those record tapes. I want your medical analysis as
CHAPEL,What's with the captain? I've never seen him like that before.
MCCOY,I intend to find out. I'll be in the medical record library.
UHURA,"Oh, Captain. Subspace message from"
re inquiring KIRK,Not now. Have the security duty officer report to me immediately.
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,Spock?
SPOCK,Continuing scanning. Still no readings of life forms on the

KIRK,"Suppose it was composed of that rare element. A strange, gaseous"

GARROVICK,"Ensign Garrovick reporting, sir."
KIRK,Are you the new security officer?
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Was your father
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir, but I don't expect any special treatment on that"
KIRK,"You'll get none aboard this ship, Mister."
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Captain, I have a report on Ensign Rizzo. He's dead, sir."
KIRK,You knew Rizzo?
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir. We were good friends, graduated the Academy"
KIRK,You'll get a crack at what killed him. Interested?
GARROVICK,"Yes, I am, sir."
KIRK,I want four men armed with phaser two set for disrupter effect.
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir."
GARROVICK,"Reading is changing, sir."
KIRK,Spock was right. Notice the molecular shift?
GARROVICK,"Dikironium reading now, sir. Bearing ninety four mark seven,"
KIRK,"Over that rise. Take two men, circle around to the left. I'll"
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Swensen, Bardoli come with me."
KIRK,"A phaser! Come on!  Garrovick, did you?"
KIRK,"Mister Garrovick, we've studied your report. Mister Spock, begin."
SPOCK,"What was the size of the thing you saw, Ensign?"
GARROVICK,"I'd say it measured from ten to sixty cubic metres, sir. It"
SPOCK,Composition?
GARROVICK,"It was like a, a gaseous cloud. Parts of it I could see"
MCCOY,"Ensign, did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud?"
GARROVICK,"Did I what, sir?"
MCCOY,Did you get any subconscious impressions that this was a
GARROVICK,"No, sir."
KIRK,"But you didn't come to actual contact with it, did you?"
GARROVICK,"No, sir. I was furthest away from it. It seemed to come out"
KIRK,Did you say it hovered?
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"You did fire at it, didn't you?"
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir, I did."
KIRK,What distance were you from the creature?
GARROVICK,"About twenty yards, sir."
KIRK,"You fired at a large, hovering target at that distance and"
GARROVICK,"Yes. I, er, well, I didn't fire while it was hovering, sir."
KIRK,You mean you froze?
GARROVICK,"No, sir. I didn't exactly freeze."
KIRK,What exactly were you doing?
GARROVICK,"Well, I was startled for a second. And then by the time I"
KIRK,Do you have any further information?
GARROVICK,"No, sir."
KIRK,Do you gentlemen have any further questions?
GARROVICK,"I only hesitated for a moment, sir. I'm sorry."
KIRK,"Ensign, you're relieved of all duties and confined to quarters"
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir. "
MCCOY,"You were a little hard on the boy, Jim."
KIRK,He froze. One man was killed. Another may die.
SPOCK,"Captain, scientifically"
KIRK,You'll both be filing reports. Make your comments and
SCOTT,"Captain, while we're waiting I've taken the"
KIRK,"We're not leaving orbit, Mister Scott. Not that quickly."
UHURA,"Captain, the Yorktown requesting information on how soon we"
KIRK,Thank you.
SCOTT,The medicine for Theta Seven colony is not only needed
desperately and has limited KIRK,"I'm aware of the situation, Engineer, and I'm getting a little"
SCOTT,"Agreed, sir."
KIRK,Scanner readings?
CHEKOV,"Nothing, sir. Continuing to scan."
KIRK,Are you aware it can change its molecular structure?
CHEKOV,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Are you scanning for any unusual movement?
CHEKOV,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Any type of gaseous cloud?
CHEKOV,We've run a full scanner probe twice.
KIRK,Then run it twenty
SPOCK,"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Interrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance, Mister"
SPOCK,I need your advice.
MCCOY,Then I need a drink.
SPOCK,I do not understand your reasoning.
MCCOY,You need advice from me? You must be kidding.
SPOCK,"I do not joke, Doctor. Perhaps I should rephrase my statement. I"
MCCOY,Jim and his creature?
SPOCK,Precisely. Have you studied the incident involving the USS
MCCOY,"No. With all these deaths and injuries, I've only had a chance"
SPOCK,"Fortunately, I read somewhat faster. In brief, Doctor, nearly"
MCCOY,The same as our Ensign.
SPOCK,His father. Among the survivors was a young officer on his first

KIRK,Kirk to bridge. Scanning report.
KIRK,Maintain search. Kirk out. It can't have just vanished.
MCCOY,"Sometimes they do, if we're lucky. Monsters come in many forms."
KIRK,Get to the point.
MCCOY,"Jim, When a young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the"
KIRK,Ensign Garrovick is a ship-command decision. You're straying out
MCCOY,Am I? I was speaking of Lieutenant James T. Kirk of the starship
KIRK,Because I delayed in firing at it.
MCCOY,You had a normal emotion. You were startled. You delayed firing
KIRK,"If I hadn't delayed, it would have been killed."
MCCOY,The ship's exec didn't seem to think so. His log entry was quite
KIRK,Don't you understand? It killed two hundred crewmen.
MCCOY,"Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim?"
KIRK,Yes. He was my commanding officer from the day I left the
MCCOY,"You don't know that, Jim. You don't know that any more than you"
KIRK,"I can't help how I feel. There's an intelligence about it, Bones."
MCCOY,To be so obsessed.
KIRK,Obsessed?
MCCOY,"That you could destroy yourself, your career, a young boy who"
KIRK,Don't push our friendship past the point where I have to take

Werespectfully ask permission to inquire further KIRK,Blast it! Forget the manual! Ask your questions.
SPOCK,"Sir, the USS Yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point. It"
carries perishable drugs KIRK,"Skip the recitation, Spock. I know the facts."
MCCOY,"They need those vaccines on Theta Seven, Captain. Now why are we"
KIRK,Because I'm convinced that this is the same creature that
SPOCK,"Creature, Captain?"
KIRK,"My report is on the tapes. As it attacked us eleven years ago, as"
SPOCK,"You say you could sense its intelligence, Captain? How did it"
MCCOY,You state that it happened just as you lost consciousness. A
KIRK,"Whatever it is, Doctor, whatever it is, wouldn't you call it"
MCCOY,"Yes, there's no doubt about that."
KIRK,And what if it is the same creature that attacked eleven years
SPOCK,"Obviously, Captain, if it is an intelligent creature, if it is"
KIRK,"A lot of ifs, I agree, but in my command judgment, they out weigh"
MCCOY,"Jim, we're not trying to gang up on you."
KIRK,"And you haven't, Doctor. You've expressed the proper concern,"
MCCOY,"At this point, my medical log remains open."
KIRK,"In that case, gentlemen"
KIRK,Kirk here.
CHEKOV,"I have a reading on the whatever it is, Captain. Leaving the"
KIRK,"All decks, Red Alert. Red alert. Prepare to leave orbit."
SCOTT,"Captain, we can't maintain warp eight speed"
KIRK,"Range, Mister Chekov?"
SPOCK,"We are barely closing in on it, Captain. We could be pursuing it"
KIRK,"If necessary. Do what you can to increase our speed, Scott."
SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Extreme magnification, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,"Magnification twelve. There, sir. Got it."
KIRK,"Spock, how do you read that?"
SPOCK,"Conflicting data, Captain. It seems to be in a borderline state"
KIRK,"And you don't find that sophisticated, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Extremely efficient, Captain. Whether that indicates"
CHEKOV,Open hatch on impulse engine number two. Mister Scott was doing
KIRK,We won't be using the impulse engines. Turn the alarm off.
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Captain, we can't do it. If we keep this speed, we'll blow up"
KIRK,Go to warp six.
CHAPEL,"Hi. Everyone else is at alert station, so I"
GARROVICK,I'm not hungry.
CHAPEL,Doctor's orders.
GARROVICK,What's happening?
CHAPEL,Are we still chasing that thing half way across the galaxy?
GARROVICK,"What do you mean, out of it? I caused it. You know that,"
CHAPEL,"You know, self-pity's a terrible first course. Why don't you"
GARROVICK,"I told you, Christine, I'm not hungry."
CHAPEL,Doctor McCoy thought you might say something like that. This is
MCCOY,What's that?
CHAPEL,Hmm?  This?
MCCOY, A survey on Cygnian Respiratory Diseases? I thought
CHAPEL,Applying psychology.
CHEKOV,The creature is slowing. It's down to warp
KIRK,Reduce speed. Approach slowly.
CHEKOV,I don't understand. It was outrunning us.
KIRK,Maybe it's decided to fight. Phasers ready?
CHEKOV,"Phasers show ready, sir."
CHEKOV,"It's coming to a full halt, sir."
KIRK,"Move in closely, Mister Chekov. Sublight one quarter speed."
GARROVICK,"Captain, request permission to return to my post."
CHEKOV,"Within phaser range, sir."
KIRK,Lock all phasers on target.
CHEKOV,Locked on target.
KIRK,"Fire phasers, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,"Phasers ineffectual, sir."
KIRK,Photon torpedoes. Minimum spread pattern.
CHEKOV,"Minimum pattern ready, sir."
KIRK,Fire photon torpedoes.
UHURA,"There. It's coming, sir."
KIRK,Deflectors up.
CHEKOV,"Deflectors up, sir."
SPOCK,"The deflectors will not stop it, Captain."
SCOTT,That's impossible.
SPOCK,I should have surmised this. For the creature to be able to use
CHEKOV,Five seconds to contact. All hatches and vents secure. All

MCCOY,One man has a chance for survival. The other is dead. You can

MCCOY,It's not enough! You didn't care as long as you could hang your

MCCOY,"Creature, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"It turned and attacked, Doctor. Its method was well-considered"
KIRK,"Yes, well, it could have been many light years away from us."
SPOCK,"Impossible to tell, Captain, until I can make a closer survey of"
KIRK,"Scotty, try flushing the radioactive waste into the ventilation"
SCOTT,Aye. 
MCCOY,"I'm sorry, Jim. I was wrong. "
SPOCK,"Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync"
KIRK,"If you want to play analyst, Spock, use someone else, not me. My"
GARROVICK,Come in.
SPOCK,"Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed"
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,I know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than
GARROVICK,"Mister Spock, it's very kind of you to come here"
SPOCK,"Kindness, Mr. Garrovick, is another human emotion, and I believe"
GARROVICK,"Sir, it's coming through the vent."
SPOCK,Get out of here! I'll attempt to seal it off.
GARROVICK," Sir, the creature's in"
KIRK,"On my way, Garrovick. Security to three four"
KIRK,"Security, hold it. Tricorder."
MCCOY,"Jim, Spock may be dying."
KIRK,"If we let that thing into the ship, he'll have a lot of company."
GARROVICK,I must have jammed the vent control when I hit it.
KIRK,See if the reverse pressure has pulled it back into the
GARROVICK,"He saved my life, Captain. I should be lying dead in there,"
SPOCK,"Fortunately, neither of us is dead, Ensign. The reverse pressure"
KIRK,"Don't misunderstand my next question. Mister Spock, why aren't"
MCCOY,It's that green blood of his.
SPOCK,"My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron."
MCCOY,"I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth, too."
SPOCK,"Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct."
KIRK,Yes. The scent is different. I think I understand something now.
SPOCK,Do you believe you're in communication with the creature?
KIRK,"I don't know what it is, Mister Spock, but you remember I said"
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,Open the vent. On my way to the bridge. Kirk out. Ensign
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,You were on the bridge when we were attacked.
GARROVICK,"Yes, I'm sorry, sir. I know I was confined to quarters, but"
when the alert sounded KIRK,"Very commendable, Ensign. What was your impression of the battle?"
GARROVICK,"I don't understand, sir."
KIRK,I'm asking for your military appraisal of the techniques used
GARROVICK,"Ineffective, Captain. I realise, Captain, you did everything"
KIRK,"And Ensign, what is your appraisal of your conduct on the planet?"
GARROVICK,I delayed firing.
KIRK,"If you hadn't delayed firing? No difference, Ensign. No weapon"
GARROVICK,"Yes, Captain. Thank you, sir."
KIRK,"Report, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,"Results positive, Captain. The creature has left the ship at"
KIRK,"Direction, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"It was bearing one two seven mark nine, but I've lost it now."
KIRK," Mister Scott, I'll need all the speed you can"
SPOCK,"It has changed course before to mislead us, Captain. Logic would"
dictate that KIRK,"No, I'm playing intuition. Mister Chekov, compute a course for"
CHEKOV,Computed and on the board.
KIRK,Ahead full.
CHEKOV,"Ahead full, sir."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet and the USS Yorktown."
UHURA,"Frequency open and clear, sir."
KIRK,Inform them that we are pursuing the creature to planet four of
SPOCK,"I do not understand, Captain."
KIRK,"In Garrovick's quarters, I said the scent of the creature was"
SPOCK,"And you know where home is, Captain?"
KIRK,"Yes, I think I do. I don't know how I know, but home is where it"
CHEKOV,"One point seven days, sir."
KIRK,We will rendezvous with the USS Yorktown in forty eight hours.
MCCOY,I assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and
SPOCK,Precisely.
KIRK,You don't agree with Mister Spock?
MCCOY,It's the time factor that bothers me. Those drugs are
SPOCK,"Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn. If so,"
KIRK,Antimatter seems our only possibility.
SPOCK,An ounce should be sufficient. We can drain it from the ship's

GARROVICK,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,I presume you intend to use that haemoplasm to attract the

KIRK,"The blast, yes."

It therefore seems logical forme to be the one KIRK,"Negative, Mister Spock. In case this plan fails, I'll need you"
SPOCK,It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit.
GARROVICK,"I'd like permission to go with you, sir."
KIRK,"I had you in mind, Mister Garrovick."
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Proceed immediately to maximum orbit.
GARROVICK,"Just think, Captain, less than one ounce of antimatter here"
KIRK,Let's hope it's as powerful as man will ever get. Detonator.
GARROVICK,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"Spock here, Captain. Holding at thirty"
KIRK,Antimatter container positioned and armed.
GARROVICK,"Captain, look!"
GARROVICK,The haemoplasm. The bait's already taken.
KIRK,We'll need something else for bait.
GARROVICK,"Sir, that thing only feeds on blood."
KIRK,"Garrovick, get back to the ship. Tell them to prepare to"
GARROVICK,"Captain, you're not going to be the bait."
KIRK,"I said, get back to the ship. Ensign, I gave you an order."
GARROVICK,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Consider yourself on report. This is no time for heroics. I have

GARROVICK,"I can smell it, Captain. It's sickening. Honey sweet."
KIRK,"Stand by, Enterprise.  Now! Energise and"
SPOCK,Reset. Energise.
MCCOY,Do something.
SPOCK,"We are, Doctor. Cross-circuiting to A."
SCOTT,"Got them. A piece of them, anyway."
SPOCK,Cross-circuiting to B.
MCCOY,"Crazy way to travel, spreading a man's molecules all over the"

Original Airdate,"22 Dec, 1967"
SCOTT,"Captain, I think I'm going to like Argelius."
KIRK,Obviously a man of good taste.
SCOTT,"You mean to tell me all these women, that all this is"
KIRK,"Yes, yes, yes. The Argelians think very highly of their pleasure."
MCCOY,That's an understatement if I ever heard one. This is a

SCOTT,Aye. Why shouldn't I?
KIRK,Good. I've invited her to join us at the table. I thought you

KIRK,"We won't leave without you, Scotty. Relax and enjoy yourself."

MCCOY,"Oh, yes, yes. As a matter of fact, considerable psychological"
KIRK,He seems he's overcoming his resentment.
MCCOY,"Of course, in my professional opinion, when he gets back to the"
KIRK,"Mission accomplished as far as Scotty is concerned. Bones, I know"
a little place across town where the women MCCOY,Oh yes. I know the place. Let's go.
MCCOY,"She's dead, Jim."
KIRK,"Stabbed, a dozen times."
HENGIST, I don't know what
KIRK,"We're just as shocked as you are, Mister Hengist."
HENGIST,"If this was my home planet, Rigel Four, I'd have a dozen"
MCCOY,"You're not a native of Argelius, sir?"
HENGIST,"Oh, no. Argelius hires its administrative officers from other"
SCOTT,"I, I don't remember."
HENGIST,"Really, sir. That is hardly helpful."
KIRK,"Scotty, you left the cafe with the girl. Do you remember that?"
SCOTT,We were walking in the fog. I was up ahead trying to lead the
KIRK,"Scotty, you've got to remember."
MCCOY,"Jim.  If he says he can't remember,"
KIRK,I know a murder's been committed.
MCCOY,You don't think by any chance that Scotty
KIRK,It doesn't make any difference what I think.
MCCOY,But you don't just throw him to the wolves.
KIRK,"Bones, I have a diplomatic responsibility. This happened under"
MCCOY,But he's suffering from a severe concussion.
KIRK,We'll do what we can.
HENGIST,"It's not promising, Captain. Mister Scott insists he remembers"
KIRK,"Yes. Mister Hengist, there were other people in the cafe about"
HENGIST,So I've been informed by the staff. They're being located and
KIRK,What's the law in these cases?
JARIS,The law of Argelius is love.
HENGIST,"Gentlemen, our prefect, Jaris. Sir, Captain Kirk, Doctor"
JARIS,"And this is my wife, Sybo."
HENGIST,"And this man is Scott, the one I sent you the message about."
JARIS,"He does not look like a man capable of such an act. Still, it's"
MCCOY,The Argelian empathic contact?
JARIS,You know of this?
KIRK,"Yes, we've heard of it. I assumed it was a lost art."
JARIS,My wife is a descendent of the ancient priestesses of our land.
HENGIST,"Prefect, don't you think this should be handled in an official"
JARIS,"It shall be handled in an official manner, Mister Hengist, since"

KIRK,Explain.

JARIS,"Are you ready, Sybo?"
SYBO,"I am ready. May I have the knife, please?"
JARIS,"Certainly. Among other gifts, Sybo has the ability to receive"
KIRK,The knife? No.
JARIS,But I put it here when we arrived. It's gone.
KIRK,Scotty.

MCCOY,Is that all that happened?
SCOTT,"I tell you, I don't remember. I must have passed out."
MCCOY,"It could be, Jim. That head injury."
KIRK,"That head injury. Think, Scotty."
SCOTT,"Captain, I've been trying. I can't even believe this is really"

KIRK,Where've they been during the past few minutes?
HENGIST,"Captain, if you don't mind please."
KIRK,"There's been another murder, Hengist. One of my crew."
JARIS,The same as Kara.
HENGIST,"Why, that's terrible.  You, my"
MORLA,"Please, I know nothing about it. I didn't kill anyone."
HENGIST,"Well, how was the girl killed?"
KIRK,Stabbed. And there's no sign of the weapon.
HENGIST,If only I had facilities.
KIRK,You. You were a musician at the cafe. You played for the murdered
TARK,"Since she was a little girl, she danced for me. She was my"
KIRK,And you. You left the cafe before Scott and Kara.
JARIS,Is this true? Who are you?
MORLA,"Morla of Cantaba Street, Prefect. I was there. I have nothing to"
KIRK,Did you know Kara?
TARK,"Of course he knew her. They were to be married, but he behaved"
JARIS,That is very disquieting.
MORLA,"I know it was wrong, but I just couldn't help myself. I loved"
KIRK,Jealousy has often been a motive for murder.
JARIS,"Yes, I know. That is why the emotion is so strongly disapproved"
MORLA,"Prefect, I didn't kill anyone. I couldn't."
JARIS,"We shall see, Morla."
MCCOY,"Sorry, Jim. The lock may or may not have been picked. It would"
KIRK,Can you prove you went directly home?
HENGIST,"Captain, may I continue with the questions please?"
KIRK,"Well get on with it, man. Just don't stand there."
JARIS,"Captain, Captain. You're behaving very much like a man who is"
KIRK,"Well of course I'm trying to save my friend, if he's innocent."

SPOCK,Simply that we beam Mister Scott on board

KIRK,"I don't like it any more than you do, Spock,"
SYBO,Let us begin. Let the circle not be broken. Concentrate upon the

MCCOY,"I don't care what the circumstances indicate, Jim. Scotty simply"
KIRK,"Normally, no, but that blow on his head could"
SCOTT,"No, Captain."
HENGIST,"I agree with you, Captain. I'm perfectly satisfied Mister"
KIRK,But not responsible.
HENGIST,"That is unproven, sir."
KIRK,"We can prove it, if he's insane."
JARIS,"Gentlemen, please. How could any man do such monstrous things?"
KIRK,"That's what we hope to find out, sir."
JARIS,Mister Scott?
SCOTT,"Sir, I swear to you I did not kill your wife or the other"

JARIS,"If this is so, you may have killed without knowing it. Will your"
KIRK,No doubt will remain.
JARIS,"Very well. We will go to your ship, and he who is guilty will"

KIRK,"Scotty, lie to me. How old are you?"
SCOTT,Twenty two sir.

JARIS,"For the time being, we will accept Captain Kirk's explanation of"
KIRK,"We can ask no more. Mister Morla, will you take the stand?"
KIRK,Where were you at the time that Kara was murdered?
MORLA,"I'm not sure. Walking home, I assume. I was angry."
SPOCK,"Anger is a relative state, sir. Were you angry enough to do"
MORLA,I've never done violence in my life. I don't think I could.
TARK,"That's not true! He might think she loved him, but she didn't."

MORLA,No.

KIRK,"All right, then, what was it she said, exactly? A monstrous evil,"
MCCOY,That devours all life and light.
KIRK,"She said something else, words that didn't make sense."
MCCOY,"Yes. Redjac, Beratis and, er, Kesla."
KIRK,"Obscure, meaningless words."
SPOCK,"To us, perhaps, but to the computer?"
KIRK,"Ah. Mister Spock, check them out."
SPOCK,"Computer, linguistic bank. Definition of following word. Redjac."
COMPUTER,Working. Negative finding.
SPOCK,There is no such word in the linguistics bank?

KIRK,"No. We beamed it out into open space, Scotty. Widest possible"

KIRK,"Bones, what have you got for a headache?"
MCCOY,Let me guess. Klingons? Baris?
KIRK,Both. How many of these did Uhura give you?
MCCOY,Just one.

MCCOY,"You noticed that, huh? Here. This ought to take care of it."
KIRK,How do they? How do they?
MCCOY,"I haven't figured that out yet, but I can tell you this much."
KIRK,A fat tribble.
MCCOY,No. You get a bunch of hungry little tribbles.

SCOTT,"Uh, no, thanks."
JONES,Oh. Perhaps one of you other gents?
JONES,"Ah, friend Klingon. Can I interest you in a harmless tribble?"
KORAX,Get it away from me.
JONES,I'm sorry. I can't understand it. I've never seen them act this
KORAX,Get out of here with that parasite.
JONES,He's only a harmless little
KORAX,Take it away!
JONES,"Yes. Ah, my good friend. How would you like to enter another"
a tribble for a spot BARMAN,A tribble.
JONES,Indeed.
BARMAN,(starts producing tribbles from all over the place and putting
SCOTT,"When are you going to get off that milk diet, lad?"
CHEKOV,This is vodka.
SCOTT,"Where I come from, that's soda pop. This is a drink for a man."
CHEKOV,Scotch?
SCOTT,Aye.
CHEKOV,It was invented by a little old lady from Leningrad.
KORAX,"The Earthers like those fuzzy things, don't they?"
JONES,"Oh, yes."
KLINGON,"Frankly, I never liked Earthers. They remind me of Regulan"
CHEKOV,That Cossack.
SCOTT,"Easy, lad. You ought to be more forgiving."
KORAX,No. I just remembered. There is one Earthman who doesn't remind
SCOTT,"Take it easy, lad. Everybody's entitled to an opinion."
KORAX,"That's right, and if I think that Kirk is a Denebian slime"
SCOTT,"Don't do it, mister, and that's an order."
CHEKOV,You heard what he called the captain.
SCOTT,Forget it. It's not worth fighting for. We're big enough to take
KORAX,"Of course, I'd say that Captain Kirk deserves his ship. We like"
CHEKOV,Mister Scott!
SCOTT,"Laddie, don't you think you should rephrase that?"
KORAX,"You're right, I should. I didn't mean to say that the Enterprise"
KIRK,"I want to know who started it. I'm waiting. Freeman, who started"
FREEMAN,"I don't know, sir."
KIRK,"All right. Chekov. I know you. You started it, didn't you?"
CHEKOV,"No, sir, I didn't."
KIRK,Who did?
CHEKOV,"I don't know, sir."
KIRK,"I don't know, sir. I want to know who threw the first punch. All"
SCOTT,"Aye, Captain."
KIRK,"Who threw the first punch, Scotty?"
SCOTT,Um.
KIRK,Mister Scott?
SCOTT,"I did, Captain."
KIRK,"You did, Mister Scott? What caused it, Scotty?"
SCOTT,"They insulted us, sir."
KIRK,Must have been some insult.
SCOTT,"Aye, it was."
KIRK,You threw the first punch.
SCOTT,"Aye. Chekov wanted to, but I held him back."
KIRK,You held? Why did Chekov want to start a fight?
SCOTT,"Well, the Klingon, sir. Is this off the record?"
KIRK,"No, this is not off the record."
SCOTT,"Well, Captain, the Klingons called you, uh a tin-plated,"
KIRK,Is that all?
SCOTT,"No, sir. They also compared you with a Denebian slime devil."
KIRK,I see.
SCOTT,And then they said you
KIRK,"I get the picture, Scotty."
SCOTT,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"After they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons?"
SCOTT,"No, sir."
KIRK,No?
SCOTT,"No, I didn't. You told us to avoid trouble."
KIRK,"Oh, yes."
SCOTT,"And I didn't see that it was worth fighting about. After all,"
KIRK,What was it they said that started the fight?
SCOTT,"They called the Enterprise a garbage scow, sir."
KIRK,I see. And that's when you hit the Klingons?
SCOTT,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"You hit the Klingons because they insulted the Enterprise, not"
because they SCOTT,"Well, sir, this was a matter of pride."
KIRK,"All right, Scotty. Dismissed. Scotty, you're restricted to"
SCOTT," Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. That'll give me a chance to"
MCCOY,"What's the matter, Spock?"
SPOCK,There's something disquieting about these creatures.
MCCOY,Don't tell me you've got a feeling.
SPOCK,"Don't be insulting, Doctor. They remind me of the lilies of the"
MCCOY,Does everything have to have a practical use for you? They're
SPOCK,"So would an ermine violin, but I see no advantage in having one."
MCCOY,"It's a human characteristic to love little animals, especially"
SPOCK,"Doctor, I am well aware of human characteristics. I am"
MCCOY,"Spock, I don't know too much about these little tribbles yet,"
SPOCK,"What is that, Doctor?"
MCCOY,I like them better than I like you.
SPOCK,Doctor?
MCCOY,Yes?
SPOCK,They do have one redeeming characteristic.
MCCOY,What's that?
SPOCK,"They do not talk too much. If you'll excuse me, sir."
KIRK,"Doctor McCoy, would you mind coming up to the bridge? (he takes a"
UHURA,"I don't know, sir. They do seem to be all over the ship."
KIRK,Doctor McCoy.
MCCOY,"Yes? Did you want to see me, Jim? Don't look at me. It's the"
KIRK,Explain that.
MCCOY,"The nearest thing I can figure out is they're born pregnant,"
KIRK,"I know, but really"
MCCOY,"And from my observations, it seems they're bisexual, reproducing"
SPOCK,"Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor. I've been running"
UHURA,"But they do give us something, Mister Spock. They give us love."
KIRK,"Too much of anything, Lieutenant, even love, isn't necessarily a"
UHURA,"Yes, Captain."
KIRK,"Get the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship, and then"
UHURA,"Aye, aye."
KIRK,Have him find Cyrano Jones and hold him.
UHURA,Aye.
KIRK,And get these tribbles off the bridge.
UHURA,"Aye, aye, Captain."
JONES,"Captain Kirk, I'm mystified at your tone of"
KIRK,"Oh, really?"
SPOCK,Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed
JONES,Of course. What did you say?
SPOCK,"By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have,"
JONES,"If by that, you mean do they breed quickly? Of course, that's"
KIRK,Just incredibly prolific.
JONES,"Precisely, and at six credits a head, well, that is, a body, it"
KIRK,You should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this
JONES,"If I did, what would happen to man's search for knowledge? Well,"
DARVIN,"Go ahead, sir. Tell him."
BARIS,"Captain Kirk, I consider your security measures a disgrace. In"
KIRK,"On the contrary, sir. I think of this project as very important."
BARIS,I am going to report fully to the proper authorities that you
KIRK,That's a serious charge. To whom are you referring?
BARIS,To that man who just walked out of here.
KIRK,"Cyrano Jones, a Klingon agent?"
BARIS,You heard me.
KIRK,I heard you.
SPOCK,He simply could not believe his ears.
KIRK,What evidence do you have against Mister Jones?
BARIS,My assistant here has kept Mister Jones under close surveillance
Ibelieve he was involved in that little altercation between your men andthe men from KIRK,"Yes, yes. Go on. What else do you have?"
DARVIN,"Well Captain, I've checked his ship's log, and it seems that he"
BARIS,"The man is an independent scout, Captain. It is quite possible"
SPOCK,We have already checked on the background of Mister Cyrano
BARIS,But he is after my grain!
KIRK,Do you have any proof of that?
DARVIN,You can't deny he's disrupted this station.
KIRK,People have disrupted stations before without being Klingon
KIRK,My chicken sandwich and coffee. This is my chicken sandwich and
SPOCK,Fascinating.
KIRK,I want these off the ship. I don't care if it takes every man
SCOTT,"They're into the machinery, all right, and they're probably in"
KIRK,How?
SCOTT,Probably through one of the air vents.
SPOCK,"Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station."
KIRK,And in the storage compartments.  This
KIRK,Energise.
LURRY,What's wrong?
KIRK,"Plenty, if what I think's happened has happened."
KIRK,Is that door secure?
GUARD,"Yes, sir. Nothing could get in."
KIRK,Good. Open it.
GUARD,"It's not working, sir. It seems to be stuck."
KIRK,Here. Let me try it.
SPOCK,They seem to be gorged.
BARIS,"Gorged? On my grain? Kirk, I am going to hold you responsible."
KIRK,Hundreds of thousands.
SPOCK,One million seven hundred seventy one thousand five hundred
KIRK,That's assuming they got here three days ago.
SPOCK,And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of
BARIS,"Kirk, you should have known. You are responsible for turning the"
KIRK,Mister Baris
BARIS,"And I'm through being intimidated, Kirk. You have insulted me,"
KIRK,"Mister Baris, I'll hold you in irons if you don't shut up."
MCCOY,"Jim, I think I've got it. All we have to do is quit feeding"
KIRK,Now he tells me.
SPOCK,Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these.
MCCOY,"A lot of them are dead. A lot of them are alive, but they won't"
SPOCK,The logical assumption is that there is something in the grain.
KIRK,"Yes. Bones, I want the tribbles, the grain, everything analysed."
MCCOY,"I haven't figured out what keeps them alive yet. All right, if I"
BARIS,"That isn't going to do you any good, Kirk. This project is"
KIRK,"Until that inquiry, I'm still the captain. And as Captain, I want"
JONES,"Really, Captain Kirk, I must protest this treatment."
KIRK,"Ah, Mister Jones, with an armful. A few questions."
KOLOTH,Captain Kirk!
KIRK,What do you want?
KOLOTH,An official apology addressed to the Klingon High Command. I
KIRK,An apology?
KOLOTH,Yes. You've harassed my men. You've treated them like
If you wish toavoid a diplomatic incident BARIS,"No, Kirk. You can't let him. That will give them the wedge they"
SPOCK,I believe that more than the word of an aggrieved Klingon
KOLOTH,"Mister Spock, as far as Sherman's Planet is concerned, Captain"
KIRK,"Well, we'll see about that, but before I take any official"
KOLOTH,"Captain Kirk, before you go on, may I make a request?"
KIRK,Yes.
KOLOTH,Can you get those things out of here?
SPOCK,Remarkable.
KIRK,Hold on a minute. I thought you said tribbles liked everybody.
JONES,They do. I can't understand it. The last time I saw one act this
KIRK,What was in the bar?
JONES,"Klingons. Him, for one. "
KIRK,"You're right, Mister Jones. They don't like Klingons. (McCoy"
SPOCK,"Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain."
KIRK,"Obviously. Mister Baris, they like you. Well, there's no"
MCCOY, Heartbeat is all wrong. His body temperature is.
BARIS,A Klingon?
KIRK,I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that. What about
MCCOY,"Oh, yes. It was poisoned."
BARIS,Poisoned?
MCCOY,Yes. It's been impregnated with a virus. The virus turns into an
KIRK,"They starved to death. In a storage compartment full of grain,"
MCCOY,That is essentially it.
KIRK,"Mister Darvin, are you going to talk?"
DARVIN,I have nothing to say. (Kirk thrusts the tribbles into his
KIRK,And the tribbles had nothing to do with it?
DARVIN,"I don't know. I never saw one before in my life, and I hope I"
BARIS,"I'm certain that can be arranged, Darvin. Guards? If you'll"
KIRK,Captain Koloth. About that apology.
KOLOTH,Yes?
KIRK,You have six hours to get your ship out of Federation territory.
KIRK,"You know, I think I could learn to like tribbles."
JONES,"Well, Captain, I suppose I'm free to go now."
KIRK,"No, you're not. There's something I want to show you. You know"
JONES,"Captain, one little tribble isn't harmful. Captain, you wouldn't"
SPOCK,The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony.
JONES,Captain Kirk. Friend. Friend Kirk. Surely we can come to some
KIRK,There is one thing you can do.
JONES,Yes?
KIRK,"Pick up every tribble on the space station. If you do that, I'll"
JONES,It would take years.
SPOCK,"Seventeen point nine, to be exact."
JONES,Seventeen point nine years.
KIRK,Consider it Job security.
JONES,"Captain, you're a hard man. All right! All right!"
KIRK,You'll do it?
SPOCK,He'll do it.
JONES,I'll do it.
SPOCK,"Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that"
KIRK,Good. That means Sherman's Planet will get its quadrotriticale
MCCOY,And you won't find a tribble on this entire ship.
KIRK,"Bones, how did you do it?"
MCCOY,I cannot take credit for another man's work. Scotty did it.
KIRK,Scotty! Where are the tribbles?
SCOTT,"Oh, er, Captain, it was really Mister Spock's recommendation."
KIRK,Of course. Spock.
SPOCK,"Based on computer analysis, of course, taking into account the"
possibilities of KIRK,"Gentlemen, I don't want to interrupt this mutual admiration"
MCCOY,"Tell him, Spock."
SPOCK,"Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering."
KIRK,Mister Scott. Where are the tribbles?
SCOTT,"I used the transporter, Captain."
KIRK,You used the transporter?
SCOTT,Aye.
KIRK,"Where did you transport them? Scott, you didn't transport them"
SCOTT,"Captain Kirk, that'd be inhuman."
KIRK,Where are they?
SCOTT,"I gave them a good home, sir."
KIRK, Where?
SCOTT,"I gave them to the Klingons, sir."
KIRK, You gave them to the Klingons?
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. Before they went into warp, I transported the whole"

CHEKOV,"Standard orbit, Captain."
KIRK,"Good. Mind the store, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Acknowledged, Captain."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, let's go."
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Energise, Scotty."
SCOTT,"Aye, Captain."
CHEKOV,Captain. what happened?
KIRK,It must be a transporter malfunction.
CHEKOV,That was a rough trip.
KIRK,This isn't Gamma Two. Look at the colour of that sky. (it's
UHURA,This is the craziest landing pad I've ever seen.
KIRK,That's a trinary sun.
SCOTT,Scott to Bridge.
SPOCK,Spock here.
SCOTT,"Mister Spock, the Captain, Lieutenant Uhura,"
SPOCK,I presume you mean they vanished in a manner
SCOTT,"Aye, of course I mean that. You think I'd"
SPOCK,Have you reversed controls?
SCOTT,I've made all the proper checks. There was
SPOCK,Power surge?
SCOTT,Not down here. All the dials were right and
SPOCK,"Recheck your equipment, Mister Scott. I'll"
CHEKOV,"But Captain, if we're not on Gamma Two,"
KIRK,That's what I'd like to know. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to
CHEKOV,"Mine, too."
UHURA,Captain. Look.
KIRK,Phasers on stun. Fire.  Hand-to-hand.
GALT,"Excellent, Captain Kirk. Although we expected strength and"
KIRK,Either of you hurt?
UHURA,"I don't think so, Captain."
CHEKOV,"Nobody's hurt, Captain. Yet."
GALT,"Admirable, Chekov. Admirable. You also, Uhura. Your spirit is as"
GALT,"There, Captain. Now you are prepared for your training."
KIRK,How do you know our names?
GALT,"The Providers were expecting you, Captain. They arranged your"
KIRK,"These Providers of yours, are they"
GALT,"Correction, Captain. The Providers are not ours. We are theirs."
KIRK,What do they want from us?
GALT,"You are to be trained, of course. What other use is there for"
KIRK,Thralls? You must be mistaken. We're officers of a United
GALT,"There has been no mistake. Your old titles mean nothing here,"
KIRK,We're not going anywhere until we have some information. Who are
GALT,"I am Galt, the Master Thrall. This place is the planet"

SPOCK,"I'm beginning to believe that, Mister Scott. I've conducted two"
MCCOY,Then what the devil is happening? Does that mean their atoms are
SPOCK,"No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors."
SCOTT,Where are they then?
SPOCK,"The only answers are negative. No magnetic storms, no ionic"
MCCOY,A negative attitude is no good to us. We can't just leave them
SPOCK,"We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor. At the moment, that is"
MCCOY,"Hope? I always thought that was a human failing, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"True, Doctor. Constant exposure does result in a certain degree"
GALT,"These are your quarters. Open, thralls."
GALT,"That was foolish, Captain. Escape is quite impossible, as"
SPOCK,They are not within the confines of this
MCCOY,It's been nearly an hour. Can people live that long as
SPOCK,"I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a"
MCCOY,"Fascinating? Those people are friends of ours out there, if"
SPOCK,Precisely.
MCCOY,The odds are not good.
SPOCK,No. I would say approximately four hundred

SPOCK,"I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as"
MCCOY,"First time you've ever asked me for anything, and it has to be"

KIRK,"This system's star is a trinary. Limits it a bit, but we're a"
LARS,I am your drill thrall. I am called Lars.
KIRK,What do you want from her?
LARS,That is not your concern. Your drill thralls will attend you
KIRK,"Lieutenant, are you all right? Uhura! Lieutenant! Lieutenant, are"
LARS,It is not allowed to refuse selection.
SHAHNA,: Step away from the door. 
SPOCK,"Captain's log, stardate 3259.2. First"
HAINES," Mister Spock, I'm"
SPOCK,Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail.
MCCOY,"What would account for that, Spock?"
SPOCK,"Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor."
SCOTT,"Well, the transporter has neither the power nor the range to"
SPOCK,"Plot a follow course, Ensign Haines."
HAINES," Aye, sir."
MCCOY,You're going to leave here without them and run off on some wild

SPOCK,Initiate. Warp factor two.
CHEKOV,"You, you have been selected for me?"
TAMOON, No. I am only your drill thrall. I have
CHEKOV,Chekov.
TAMOON,Chee-koof! It is a very nice name. I am called Tamoon.
CHEKOV," Oh, pleased, Pleased to know you,"
TAMOON,You are a fine specimen. I like you better than the others. I
CHEKOV,"That's very kind of you, miss, but"
TAMOON,"If my Provider is pleased, we may even be selected for each"
KIRK,I didn't realise I was so hungry. Whatever
SHAHNA,It is nourishment. We call it that.
KIRK,Nourishment. That's very practical. What do you call this collar?
SHAHNA,It is a sign of our Provider. By the colour of the lights it
KIRK,"Vended? You mean bought, sold."
SHAHNA,When you are developed. The Provider who offers the most
KIRK,Our race has another name for it. Slavery. This collar of
SHAHNA,It is only to warn and punish.
KIRK,How does he work it?
SHAHNA,It is not permitted to talk of that.
KIRK,Will you provide all my nourishment?
SHAHNA,Of course. I am your drill thrall. I will train you well.
KIRK,"Yes, I'm sure you will. I must say, I've never seen a top"
SHAHNA,What does that mean?
KIRK,It means you're a very beautiful woman.
SHAHNA,What is beautiful?
KIRK,"You mean nobody's ever told you that before? well, er, beautiful"
SHAHNA,Born? I have been here always.
KIRK,Your parents. Where are they? Your mother and father.
SHAHNA,She who bore me was killed in a freestyle match.
KIRK,Freestyle?
SHAHNA,You will learn all these things.
KIRK,Lars and Chekov's drill thrall. They weren't born here. Where do
SHAHNA,It is not permitted. 
MCCOY,This is ridiculous. There's nothing out
SCOTT,We certainly seem to be heading into an empty sector.
SPOCK,"Projecting back along the path of ionisation, the nearest system"
SCOTT,That must be two dozen light years away.
SPOCK,Eleven point six three zero.
MCCOY,Are you suggesting that they could have transported over a

GALT,Hold. This thrall was slow in obeying a command. For his
UHURA,No!
GALT,It is not allowed to refuse a training exercise.
UHURA,I don't care whether it's allowed or not. I will not do it.
KIRK,"None of us will do it, Galt."
GALT,It is part of your training. The Providers wish it.
KIRK,The devil with the Providers.
CHEKOV,Cossacks.
GALT,"We have been tolerant because you are newcomers, but I see you"
KIRK,No. No! I am responsible for the actions of my people. I demand
GALT,"It is not permitted. But, Captain, since you assume"
GALT,Hold. Rest interval. Fifteen trisecs.
KIRK,He's pretty fast with that whip.
SHAHNA,This will strengthen you. Drink it. Kloog's left eye is weak.
GALT,Resume places.
GALT,"We hold, Provider One."
GALT, Two thousand quatloos are bid. Is there a

GALT,"You now bear the mark of a fine herd. But I must warn you, any"
SCOTT,"Mister Spock, it just doesn't make sense"
SPOCK,We searched the area.
SCOTT,It's always possible to miss something.
SPOCK,Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism?
SCOTT,"No, sir. There was no sign of failure."
SPOCK,There was no sign of them in the area of Gamma Two.
MCCOY,If they weren't there it's ridiculous to think they could still
SPOCK,"In that case, Doctor, we have nothing to lose by pursuing our"
KIRK,Slow down. Slow down. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We've covered
SHAHNA, Oh. Very well. You are tired.
KIRK,"Oh. well, it's good to get away from that development area, even"
SHAHNA,That is the way.
KIRK,Their voices sound mechanical. Are they computers?
SHAHNA,Computers?
KIRK,You've seen them. Do they have bodies?
SHAHNA,Not such as ours.
KIRK,What is this place?
SHAHNA,It is not used.
KIRK,"It's very old. Does it have a name? Shahna, could it have been a"
SHAHNA,I do not think it is well to ask such things.
KIRK,"They do have bodies, or did have."
SHAHNA,One does not talk of such things.
KIRK,"Very pretty country. Very much like my home planet, Earth."
SHAHNA,Planet?
KIRK,"Where I was born. Shahna, don't you ever look at the night sky?"
SHAHNA,I have looked at them.
KIRK,"Well, those are stars. And around them are planets. And there are"
SHAHNA,How can one live on a flicker of light?
KIRK,"From Earth, Triskelion's three suns are just a flicker of light."
SHAHNA,"Dark? But all is lighted. Here, the chambers."
KIRK,"The thralls have no freedom, Shahna. You don't think or do"
SHAHNA,What else would one do?
KIRK,"Love, for one thing."
SHAHNA,What is love?
KIRK,Love is the most important thing on Earth. Especially to a man
SHAHNA,"We, too, have mates. When it is time to increase the herd, my"
KIRK,"On Earth, we select our own mate. Someone we care for. On Earth,"
SHAHNA,I do not think your words are allowed.
KIRK,All right. All right. Tell me about the Providers. What do they
SHAHNA,"I have never seen them, but they are said not to be like us."
KIRK,Stop it. Stop it! I'm responsible! I made her talk! Stop it!
KIRK,"It's all right. It's all right. You can stop crying now, Shahna."
SHAHNA,You risked bringing their anger on yourself. Why did you do it?
KIRK,It's the custom of my people to help one another when we're in
SHAHNA,And this. Is this also helping?
KIRK,You could call it that.
SHAHNA,"Please, help me once again.  I did not know it"
GALT," Captain, you do indeed present many"

SCOTT,Mister Spock!
MCCOY,"Who said anything about a mutiny, you stubborn, pointed-eared."
SPOCK,"Agreed. Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven?"
SCOTT,"I would be more than content to do so, sir, and maybe a wee bit"
SPOCK,"Ensign, warp seven."
KIRK,You're disturbed about what happened today.
SHAHNA,"Yes. You have made me feel strangely. If it were allowed, I"
KIRK,"I wouldn't like that, Shahna. I wouldn't like that at all."
KIRK,"I'm sorry, Shahna. "
CHEKOV,This is going to kill our romance.
KIRK,What about Lars?

SPOCK,"Daniel, as I recall, had only his faith. But I welcome your"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,Spock? Spock!
KIRK,"Welcome to Triskelion, gentlemen."
SCOTT,"What the voice said was true, sir. Nothing is functioning."
KIRK,Providing for all their needs means using
SPOCK,Fascinating.
KIRK,But you are afraid.
KIRK,Then show yourselves.
KIRK,The power source. Shielded by solid rock.
KIRK,Primary mental evolution. Incredible.
KIRK,"A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior, mentally"
KIRK,"It's an unproductive purpose, unworthy of your intellect."

KIRK,You will educate and train them to establish a normal

KIRK,Name it.
KIRK,Three against one? Those are pretty high odds.
KIRK,"Your, your terms are unfair."
KIRK,"Well, in that case, I'll accept your terms."
SCOTT,"Mister Spock, look!"
KIRK,"Yes, that's clear."
MCCOY,What in the name of heaven is this?
SCOTT,Heaven's got very little to do with this.
GALT,Shahna.
SHAHNA,You lied. Everything you said.
SHAHNA,The thralls surrender!
KIRK,The thralls will be trained?
KIRK,I think you'll find it a much more exciting game than the one
SHAHNA,"I understand, a little. You will leave us now?"
KIRK,Yes.
SHAHNA,To go back to the lights in the sky?
KIRK,Yes.
SHAHNA,I would like to go to those lights with you. Take me?
KIRK,I can't.
SHAHNA,"Then teach me how, and I will follow you."
KIRK,There's so much you must learn here first. The Providers will

KIRK,"Boss? All right, Lieutenant, put him on. Oxmyx. This is Captain"
KIRK,"Yes. Unfortunately, the Horizon was lost with all hands shortly"
KIRK,Difficult to explain. We received a report a hundred years late

KIRK,We don't know there is contamination. The evidence is only

KIRK,The beginnings of industrialisation.
SPOCK,Horizon reports indicate the Iotians are

SPOCK,"The damage has been done, Doctor. We are here to repair it."
KIRK,Let's not argue about it. Let's go study it. Energise.
SPOCK,Fascinating.
MCCOY,This is like coming home.
KIRK,Home was never like this. I've seen pictures of the old days that
SPOCK,"Interesting, Captain. Passers-by are carrying, I believe,"
KALO," Okay, you three, let's see you petrify."
SPOCK,"Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please?"
KALO,"I want to see you turn to stone. Put your hands over your head,"
KALO,What's this?
KIRK,That's a weapon. Be careful with that.
KALO,"A heater, huh? Hey, the boss will love that. (puts it in his"
KIRK,"Look, we were asked to come down here by Mister Oxmyx. He said"
KALO,"I know what he said, bud. He said some of the boys would meet"
MCCOY,"Well, those firearms are not necessary."
KALO,You trying to make trouble?
MCCOY,"Who, me?"
KALO,Don't give me those baby blue eyes.
MCCOY,What?
KALO,I don't go for that innocent routine.
SPOCK,"Sir, does everyone here carry firearms?"
KALO,I never heard such stupid questions in my life.
MCCOY,"Well, since this Oxmyx asked us down here, don't you think we"
KALO,All right. Get moving. Down the street.
KALO,Krako's getting more gall all the time .
KIRK,Is this how you greet all your guests?
KALO,"It happens, pal."
MCCOY,That man's dead back there.
KALO,"Yeah? We ain't playing for peanuts. What's the matter, you guys"
SPOCK,"Sir, there are several questions I would like to ask."
KALO,Ask the boss. I don't know nothing. Get moving.
MCCOY,"This is the contamination you're looking for, Jim."
KIRK,"Yes, but the Horizon crew wasn't composed of cold-blooded"
WOMAN,"Hey, Kalo. Hey, when's the boss going to do something about the"
KALO,Write him a letter.
WOMAN,"Listen, we pay our percentages. We're entitled to a little"
KALO,"Get lost, will ya? Some people got nothing to do but complain."
KIRK,"Is this the way your citizens do business, their right of"
KALO,They pay their percentages and the boss takes care of them.

OXMYX,All right. Bring them in. (he goes to the pool table and picks
KIRK,Depends.
OXMYX,"Make yourself a drink, Captain. It's good stuff. I distill it"
KIRK,"No, thank you. You're Mister Oxmyx."
OXMYX,"That's me, pal."
KIRK,"This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy."
OXMYX,"Doctor, huh? Put that chopper down, Kalo. These guys are our"
MCCOY,"Yes. Judging from what we've seen so far, I agree."
KIRK,"They call you The Boss, Mister Oxmyx. The boss of what?"
OXMYX,The boss of my territory. I got the biggest in the world. You
KIRK,You're the government here?
OXMYX,"What government? Look, I told you. I got the territory and I run"
KIRK,"But there are other bosses, other territories?"
OXMYX,"Yeah, sure. Maybe a dozen or so, not counting the small fry, but"
SPOCK,"Does that include, if I may ask, a gentleman called Krako?"
OXMYX,How do you know about Krako?
KALO,"He hit us, Boss."
OXMYX,"Okay. You hit him back, you hear? Hard."
KALO,I'll take care of it.
SPOCK,Captain? Gangsters. Chicago. Mobs. Published in 1992. Where'd
OXMYX,"Hey, wait a minute. That's the Book."
KIRK,I know it's a book.
OXMYX,"The Book. They left it, the other ship. The Horizon."
SPOCK,"This is the contamination, Captain. Astonishing. An entire"
MCCOY,"You said they were imitative, and the book"
OXMYX,I don't want any more cracks about the Book.
KIRK,Did they leave any other books?
OXMYX,Sure. Some text books on how to make radio sets and stuff like
KIRK,What is it you want?
OXMYX,"Well, I was thinking. You Feds must have made a lot of"
KIRK,Now let me get this straight. You want us to supply you with arms

KIRK,"Mister Oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit. Under no circum"
OXMYX,"I ain't interested in your orders. From now on, you're gonna"
KALO,"Hey, Boss, this here's a heater, and I don't know what this is."
OXMYX,Let's see how this thing works.
KIRK,Don't do that. You could knock out the side of the building.
OXMYX,"That good, huh? All you have to do is give me about a hundred of"
KIRK,Out of the question.
OXMYX,"Captain Kirk, I usually get what I want. What's this thing?"
KIRK,Hold it. It's a communication device.
OXMYX,How does it work?
KIRK,It's locked onto my ship's systems.
OXMYX,"Kalo, take them to the warehouse and put them in a bag. Keep a"
KALO,"In the bag, Boss. Come on."
OXMYX," Hey, you. In the ship up there."
SCOTT,Scott here. Who's this?
OXMYX,This is Bela Oxmyx. I got your captain and

SCOTT,I don't know.  Lieutenant
MCCOY,One book on the gangs of Chicago did all this. It's amazing.
SPOCK,They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an

KIRK,"In old Chicago, conventional government almost broke down. The"
MCCOY,"Yeah, well, Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all."
SPOCK,"We may quarrel with Mister Oxmyx' methods, but his goal is"
KIRK,If this society broke down as the result of the Horizon's
SPOCK,"Unfortunately, I do not have access to my computers, nor are"
KIRK,"Well, I've got an idea about that. (goes over to the card table"
KALO,"You think so, huh?"
KIRK,"Oh, yes, yes. I wouldn't waste my time."
KALO,Who's asking you?
KIRK,"On Beta Antares Four, they play a real game. It's a man's game,"
KALO,"Listen, Kirk, I can play anything you can figure out. Take the"
SPOCK,I'm familiar with the culture on Beta Antares. There aren't
games KIRK,"Spock. Spock.  Of course, the cards on Beta Antares Four"
KALO,Fizzbin?
KIRK,Fizzbin. It's not too difficult.  Each player
KALO,On the right.
KIRK,"Yes. The second card is turned up, except on Tuesdays."
KALO,On Tuesday.
KIRK,"Oh, look what you got, two jacks. You got a half fizzbin already."
KALO,I need another jack.
KIRK,"No, no. If you got another jack, why, you'd have a sralk."
KALO,A sralk?
KIRK,"Yes. You'd be disqualified. You need a king and a deuce, except"
KALO,Except at night.
KIRK,"Right. Oh, look at that. You've got another jack. How lucky you"
KALO,If it were dark on Tuesday.
KIRK,"Yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in"
SPOCK,"I have never computed them, Captain."
KIRK,"Well, they're astronomical, believe me. Now, for the last card."
KALO,What?
KALO,I'll get it.
KIRK,"Spock, find the radio station. Uhura's monitoring the broadcasts."
SPOCK,"Surely, you're coming, Captain."
KIRK,"I will, but I'm bringing Bela Oxmyx with me."
MCCOY,"Jim, you can't"
KIRK,"Bones, this mess is our responsibility. You have your orders."
ZABO,"Hold it! Okay, pally, we're going for a ride."
KIRK,"If you don't mind, I'd rather walk."
ZABO,"Listen, pally, this could either be a taxi or a hearse. You know"
KIRK,I'm beginning to get the idea.
MCCOY,"You do that very well. Now, how are you with primitive radio"
SPOCK,Very simple. Amplitude modulation transmission. I simply adjust
the makers of the sweetestlittle automatic in the world SPOCK,Fascinating.
MCCOY,And very simple.
SPOCK,Let me see. (throws a few more switches and picks up the
UHURA,"Mister Spock, what are you doing on this"
SPOCK,"A very long and complicated story,"
KRAKO,"So you're the Fed, huh? Well, well, well, well, well."
KIRK,And you?
KRAKO,Krako. JoJo Krako. I'm the head of the whole Southside
KIRK,Would you mind telling me how you even know who I am?
KRAKO,"Sit down, Kirk. I've got all of Bela's communications bugged. He"
KIRK,You want to make a deal.
KRAKO,"Hey, I like that. That is sharp. That's sharp, eh, Zabo?"
ZABO,"Sharp, Boss."
KRAKO,"That's right, a deal. I want you to help me."
KIRK,"Let me guess. You want, you'll want heaters, and then you'll want"
KRAKO,"Wrong! I know Bela. He didn't offer you beans. Now, me, I'm a"
KIRK,I got a better idea. This planet has to be united. You know that.
KRAKO,"You watch it, Kirk. The Book tells us how to handle things."
KIRK,"No, I don't think you're stupid. I just think your behaviour is"
KRAKO,"I haven't been arrested in my whole life! Listen, pally, I know"
KIRK,"I'm sorry, Krako. No deal."
KRAKO,That's too bad. Put him on ice!
MCCOY,Well?
SPOCK,"Futile, Doctor. No specifics. There is no record of such a"
MCCOY,You mean you're giving up?
SPOCK,"No, Doctor. I'm merely saying the computers can offer us no"
UHURA,"Mister Spock, Mister Oxmyx is making contact from the surface."
SPOCK,"On audio, Lieutenant. Mister Oxmyx, this is Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Irrelevant, since we are here."
OXMYX,"Oh, yeah. I tell you, you'd better come on"
SPOCK,Why would he put a bag on our captain?
OXMYX,"Kidnapped him, you dope."
SPOCK,"If I understand you correctly, that would seem to be a problem."
OXMYX,"Look, you guys got something I want. I can"
SPOCK,"I'm afraid I find it difficult to trust you, Mister Oxmyx."
OXMYX,What's to trust? Business is business. We'll
SPOCK,You'll show no further hostility?
OXMYX,"I'm a businessman, pally. What do ya say?"
SPOCK,"Since we must have our captain back, I"
MCCOY,You mean you're going to trust him?
SPOCK,"If we are to save the captain without blatant, forceful"
KIRK,Help me! Help! Help me!
SPOCK,"Mister Scott, though we hope to avoid"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
MCCOY,Now you're beginning to make sense.
SPOCK,"I trust we shall not have to use them, but it is best to be"
OXMYX,You know what to do.
KALO,"Don't worry, Boss. They can't do nothing till they're through"
OXMYX,"Just the same, you be careful. They'll have heaters on them. (to"
OXMYX, Pick up many more of
SPOCK,"Mister Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce."
OXMYX,"I was hoping you'd think that, dummy."
MCCOY,"We're trying to help you, Oxmyx."
OXMYX,Nobody helps nobody but himself.
SPOCK,"Sir, you are employing a double negative."
OXMYX,Huh?
SPOCK,I fail to see why you do not understand us. You yourself have
OXMYX,"Yeah, but I got to be the unity."
SPOCK,"Co-operation, sir, would inevitably result"
OXMYX,The most co-operative man in this world is a dead man. And if
KIRK,Drop the guns. Drop 'em. (McCoy and Spock take back their
OXMYX,"Hey, Captain, you got away from Krako. You know, that ain't"
KIRK,"I thought you were supposed to report to the ship, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"We did, Captain. The situation required our return."
KIRK,It may be just as well. Did you find out anything from the
SPOCK,Nothing useful. Logic and practical information do not seem to
MCCOY,You admit that?
SPOCK,"To deny the facts would be illogical, Doctor."
KIRK,Then you don't mind if I play a hunch?
SPOCK,"I'm not sanguine about hunches, Captain, but I have no practical"
MCCOY,"What are we going to do now, Jim?"
KIRK,"Well, now that we have Bela, I'm going to put the bag on Krako."
MAN,It ought to be. It cost a bundle.
MAN,Hey!
KIRK,I said.
KALO,Now just a minute.
KIRK,You too! Get out of the clothes. Nobody's going to put the bag on
KIRK,"Wheels, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"A fliwer, Captain."
KIRK,Key in the ignition. Turn the ignition on. And nothing happens.
SPOCK,Interesting.
KIRK, Oops! Gears.
SPOCK,"Yes. Oh. I believe they had a device known as a clutch. Clutch,"
KIRK, I kind of like this. I'm going to get
SPOCK,"Captain, you are an excellent starship commander, but as a taxi"
KIRK,It was that bad?
KIRK,"Now, that could be a bit of a problem. If they were inside, where"
SPOCK,"If we can get close enough to them, we should be able to render"
KIRK,They don't look like the trusting type.
BOY," It's a hit, ain't it?"
SPOCK,I beg your pardon?
BOY,You're going to hit somebody. Can I watch?
KIRK,"Young man, run along and play."
BOY,Where'd you get them ears?
SPOCK,Young man
BOY,You going to hit Krako out here? You open up and you'll be
SPOCK,"Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous."
KIRK,"Hold on, Spock. Out of the mouths of babes"
BOY,Who you callin' a babe?
KIRK,I'm calling you a babe.
BOY,You calling me a babe? 
KIRK,"Yeah I'm calling you a babe, but there's nothing personal in it."
BOY,Sure.
KIRK,How?
BOY,What's in it for me?
KIRK,What do you want?
BOY,A piece of the action.
SPOCK,You do not even know what the action is going to be.
BOY,I figure it's got to be a thick percentage or you wouldn't be
SPOCK,Logical.
KIRK,"All right, young man. We'll guarantee you a piece of the action"
BOY,Is that a contract?
KIRK,Done.  What do we do?
BOY,You'll know what to do.
BOY,"And that! And how do you like that? Think you can gang up on me,"
BOY,"Come on, why don't you gang up on me? I'll cut off your head and"
KIRK,That's it. Let's go.
GUARD,"What's the matter? Did you hurt yourself, kid?"
BOY,I want my daddy!
GUARD,"Cute kid, ain't he?"
BOY,Daddy! I want my daddy!
KIRK,Sonny!
BOY,I want my daddy.
KIRK,Sonny! Wait a moment. What have they done? What have they done to
KIRK,A piece of the action.
KIRK,No one can see. Put your phaser on stun.
KRAKO,"Well, ain't this nice? I was wondering how I was going to get"
KIRK,"I think you've got it reversed, Mister Krako."
KRAKO,"I ain't, pally. Put down your heaters."
SPOCK,"Captain, I believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he"
I just heard the sound of KIRK,The sound of a machine gun bolt being pulled back. (there are two
KIRK,"Mister Krako, I don't, er"
KRAKO,"So this is the fancy heater, huh? How does it work?"
KIRK,"I'm trying to tell you, Mister Krako, that this is bigger than"
KRAKO,The only thing I want you to tell me is how it works.
KIRK,Can you trust all your men?
KRAKO,Of course I can!
KIRK,"Well, one of these can make a man a pretty big boss, you know."
KRAKO,"I either trust 'em, or they're dead. Let's go in here and talk"
KRAKO,Now we got no busy little eyes to worry
KIRK,"All right, Krako, we don't have time to show you how to play with"
KRAKO,Toys?
KIRK,"What do you think we're here for, to get a cut of your deal?"
SPOCK,Unquestionably.
KIRK,Right?
SPOCK,Right.
KIRK,"Now look, Krako, we're taking over the whole ball of wax. You"
SPOCK,A miniscule. A very small piece.
KRAKO,How much is that?
KIRK,"That's, er. We'll figure it out later."
KRAKO,I thought you guys had laws. No interference.
KIRK,Who's interfering? We're taking over. Check?
SPOCK,Right.
KIRK,"The planet is being taken over by the Federation, but we don't"
KRAKO,What's your cut?
KIRK,"What do you care as long as you're being cut in? Course, there's"
KRAKO,"All right, it's a deal. Call your ship. Bring down your boys and"
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"All right, Scotty. We made a deal with Krako."
SCOTT,"We did, sir?"
KIRK,Yeah. We're ready to make the hit. We're
SCOTT,"Do you think that's wise, sir?"
KIRK,"Sure. We can trust Krako, but we don't have"
SCOTT,Aye. I know indeed.
KIRK,"Scotty, we'll need phasers to equip every one"
SCOTT,Captain. We're preparing everything. It'll
KIRK,"You may begin, Mister Scott."
KRAKO,You mean you're going to start sending down your boys now?
KIRK,Not exactly.
KIRK,Right?
SPOCK,Check.
KRAKO,How the hell'd I get here? What? What happened? 
SCOTT,"It looks like we put the bag on you, doesn't it."
KRAKO,I got rights.
SCOTT,"You've got nothing. You mind your place, mister, or you'll be"
KRAKO,You mean cement overshoes?
SCOTT,Er. Aye.
SPOCK,Must we?
KIRK,It's faster than walking.
SPOCK,But not as safe.
KIRK,Are you afraid of cars?
SPOCK,"Not at all, Captain. It's your driving that alarms me."
KIRK,"Spock, I've got the hang of it. Now go on."
ZABO," Oh, not again. (rouses the other"
GUARD,Yeah? How?
ZABO,"Well, Bela's mixed up in this somehow. I've got a sneaking hunch"
MCCOY,Where are they?
OXMYX,"Knowing Krako, he'll probably send them back on a blotter."
KIRK,"Wrong again, Oxmyx."
MCCOY,Jim.
KIRK,"Knock it off, Sawbones. I want to talk to this creep. Now listen,"
OXMYX,"What do you mean, penny-ante operator?"
KIRK,"You're a penny-ante operator. Sit down. All right, Spocko, cover"
OXMYX,"Yeah, sure. Why didn't you say so in the first place? All you"
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
SCOTT,"Enterprise. Scott here, sir."
KIRK,You got Krako on ice?
SCOTT,"To chew neutronium, but behaving himself."
SCOTT,Flag me?
KIRK,Keep him until I send for him. We're going to
KIRK,Find the man at the other end of the phone
KIRK,"Can do, sweetheart?"
SCOTT,"Can do, Captain."
KIRK,Now you. Get on the blower and call the other bosses.
OXMYX,I sure don't know what you think you're talking about.
KIRK,Get with it. I'm giving the orders here.
OXMYX,Hello. Hello?
KIRK,Scotty?
OXMYX,Guess who?
KIRK,Lock in and energise.
OXMYX,"Yeah, you bet your life I've got a lot of nerve. What are you"
TEPO,Coming over with my boys and we (realises he's not where he was a
OXMYX,"Hey, Captain, that ain't bad."
KIRK,Yeah.
SPOCK,"I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx."
ZABO,All right. You know what to do. We hit Bela's
KIRK,All right! All right! All right! All right! Now the Federation's
TEPO,And what's your percentage?
KIRK,I'm cutting the Federation in for forty percent. You got any
TEPO,"Yeah! I hear a lot of talk, but all I see here is you and a"
KRAKO,Listen. They got a ship. I know. I was there.
OXMYX,Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Tepo's got a point. All we ever
TEPO,"What, a couple of boys?"
KRAKO,I'm not going to believe my eyes.
KIRK,Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. Quiet! Just a moment!
KRAKO,Let me say something. I only saw three guys in that ship. Maybe
KIRK,There are over four hundred guys there.
KRAKO,"That's your story, buster."
KRAKO,"Hey, it's my boys. They're making a hit at this place."
OXMYX,My boys will put you down.
KRAKO,Want to bet?  Keep moving. One move out
OXMYX,"Hey, that's great, Krako. Now we got hostages again. We can make"
KRAKO,"Are you kidding? This one's all mine. From now on, nobody's"
KIRK,"Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Get that heater down. Don't"
KRAKO,"I already seen it. You're nothing, Fed."
KIRK,"All right, but at least let me call my ship one last time and say"
KRAKO,"Well, all right. Go ahead. Don't get smart."
KIRK,"Hello, Scotty. This is Kirk."
SCOTT,"Enterprise. Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,"Right away, sir. Scott out."
KRAKO,"Gee, that's some trick."
OXMYX,"Hey, did you see that?"
KIRK,"They're not dead, just knocked out for a while. But they might"
OXMYX,"Okay, okay, Kirk, so we get the message. Now, what was this"
TEPO,He was talking about a percentage.
KIRK,I was talking about both.
OXMYX,Okay. A syndicate makes sense to me. I'm a peaceful man at
KIRK,"Hey, Bela, no, no, no. The Federation can't get connected with a"
TEPO,"Look, you figure maybe forty percent's enough?"
KIRK,"Yeah, I think forty percent's sufficient."
OXMYX,It's reasonable. It sounds reasonable. That sound reasonable to
KIRK,"It's reasonable, Mister Oxmyx. Let's break out some of your"
KIRK,"Gentlemen, you two have been brooding ever"
SPOCK,"Brooding, Captain?"
KIRK,"Brooding, Mister Spock. A sombre, emotional state. Now, do you"
SPOCK,"Captain, I'm neither brooding nor sombre. But I do have"
KIRK,"Ah, yes. I understand that. You don't think it's logical to leave"
SPOCK,"Highly irregular, to say the least, Captain. I'm also curious as"
KIRK,"Yes, that's a very good question, Mister Spock. I propose our cut"
MCCOY,"I don't know how serious this is, Jim, and I don't quite know"
how to tell you KIRK,Go ahead.
MCCOY,But in all the confusion I
KIRK,Tell me.
MCCOY,I think I left it in Bela's office.
KIRK,You left it?
MCCOY,Somewhere. I'm not certain.
KIRK,You're not certain of what?
MCCOY,I left my communicator.
KIRK,In Bela's office?
SPOCK,"Captain. If the Iotians, who are very bright and imitative"
should take that communicator apart KIRK,"They will, they will. And they'll find out how the transtator"
SPOCK,The transtator is the basis for every important piece of
KIRK,Everything.
MCCOY,You really think it's that serious?
KIRK,"Serious? Serious, Bones? It upsets the whole percentage."
MCCOY,How do you mean?
KIRK,"Well, in a few years, the Iotians may demand a piece of our"
Original Airdate,"19 Jan, 1968"
KIRK,"The crew has performed excellently, but is"
UHURA,Captain. There was a message from Starbase Six. Heavy
SPOCK,Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector.
KIRK,"Try another channel, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
MCCOY,"The Intrepid is manned by Vulcans, isn't it?"
KIRK,"Yes, that's right, Bones."
UHURA,Enterprise calling Starbase Six. Enterprise calling Starbase
KIRK,Spock?
MCCOY,"What is it, Spock? Are you in pain?"
SPOCK,"Captain, the Intrepid. It just died. And the four hundred"
MCCOY,"Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay."
SPOCK,"Doctor, I know what I know."
KIRK,Get to the Sickbay.
SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,"No, no, no. That's an order."
SPOCK,"Yes, sir."
UHURA,"Captain, I have Starbase Six readable now. Switching to audio,"
KIRK,Kirk here. Go ahead.
KIRK,"Sir, the Enterprise just completed an exhausting mission. We're"
KIRK,"Order acknowledged. Kirk out. Mister Kyle, you heard the order."
KYLE,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Captain I have just completed a full long-range scan of Gamma
KIRK,Dead? It's a fourth magnitude sun. There are billions of
CHEKOV,It is dead.
SPOCK,"I assure you, Doctor, I am quite all right. The pain was"
MCCOY,All of my instruments seem to agree with you if I can trust
SPOCK,I sensed it die.
MCCOY,But I thought you had to be in physical contact with a subject
before SPOCK,"Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of"
MCCOY,Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die.
SPOCK,Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to
MCCOY,But four hundred Vulcans?
SPOCK,"I've noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easier"
MCCOY,"Suffer the death of thy neighbour, eh, Spock? You wouldn't wish"
SPOCK,It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody.
KIRK,"Spock, you may have been right. We've lost"
UHURA,"I cannot filter out the distortion, sir. It's getting worse."
KYLE,"Captain, deflector shields just snapped on."
KIRK,Slow to warp three.
KYLE,"Warp three, sir."
SPOCK,Indications of energy turbulence ahead. Unable to analyse. I've
KIRK,Scanners on. Magnification three on the screen.
KYLE,"Magnification factor three, sir."
UHURA,"Exactly what are we looking for, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,I would assume that.
KIRK,What is that?
CHEKOV,Perhaps an interstellar dust cloud.
SPOCK,"Not very likely, Ensign."
KIRK,No. You'd be able to see stars through a dust cloud. Looks like a
SPOCK,"Still not able to analyse, Captain. Sensors are feeding data to"
KIRK,Hold present course. Slow to warp one.
KYLE,"Warp factor one, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, prepare to launch a telemetry probe into that"
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir. Probe ready. Switching data feed to library computer."
KIRK,Launch probe.
CHEKOV,"Probe launched, sir."
KIRK,What was that?
UHURA,"The telemetry probe, sir. There's no signal from it."
KIRK,"Speculation, Spock."
SPOCK,"I have none, Captain. Insufficient data."
SPOCK,Lieutenant.
UHURA,"I'm just dizzy. I'll be all right. I'm fine, sir."
KIRK,Kirk here. What is it?
KIRK,Uhura almost did. She says she's all right. Do you want to see
MCCOY,Not unless she's feeling ill. I've got an emergency here.
MCCOY,"There's nothing organic. They all seem to be nervous, weak, and"
MCCOY,I'm giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet.
KIRK,"Good. Kirk out. Hold our position, Mister Kyle."
KYLE,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead."
SPOCK,No analysis due to insufficient information.
KIRK,"No speculation, no information, nothing. I've asked you three"
SPOCK,"I am well aware of that, Captain, but the computers contain"
KIRK,I don't know about you but I'm tired. If you can't tell me what
SPOCK,"It is not liquid, gaseous, or solid, despite the fact we cannot"
KIRK,So far that's not much help.
SPOCK,"It is not a galactic nebula such as the Coal Sack, and since our"
KIRK,Is it possible that this is what killed that solar system and the
SPOCK,Very possible.
KIRK,Lieutenant.
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Notify the Starfleet that we're going to attempt to probe the
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
SPOCK,Captain?
KIRK,"I'm all right. Distance from zone of darkness, Mister Kyle?"
KYLE,"One hundred thousand kilometres, sir."
KIRK,Ahead slow. Impulse power only.
KYLE,"Aye, aye, sir."
UHURA,"Transmission to Starfleet complete, sir."
KIRK,"Very good. Time, Mister Chekov?"
CHEKOV,"Penetration of the zone in one minute, seven seconds, sir."
KIRK,Red Alert. Deflectors full power. Phaser banks ready.
CHEKOV,"Phasers standing by. Deflectors at full power, sir."
UHURA,"It's not coming from communications, sir."
KIRK,Spock!
SPOCK,"Analysing now, Captain."
CHEKOV,"Captain, the stars are gone!"
KIRK,"Malfunction, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Negative, Captain. All systems functioning properly."
KIRK,Then kindly tell me what happened to the stars.
SPOCK,"Unknown, Captain."
KIRK,Kirk to McCoy.
KIRK,Things any better down there?
KIRK,Have you got anything that will help up here? I don't want
KIRK,"Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, there was a power loss. How come?"
SCOTT,"We lost five percent of our energy reserve,"
SCOTT,"Aye, if we don't lose any more. Don't ask me how it happened."
KIRK,"I am asking how, mister. I want answers. Kirk"
KIRK,What's that?
MCCOY,A stimulant.
KIRK,"Bones, how bad is it?"
MCCOY,Two thirds of the personnel are affected.
KIRK,Why? How? Do you have any answers?
MCCOY,No. You know you'll get everything I can tell you. But when
MCCOY,Nurse.
KIRK,This ship is in trouble. We'd better start solving problems
SPOCK,That sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of a
KIRK,What boundary layer?
SPOCK,Unknown.
KIRK,Boundary layer between what and what?
SPOCK,Between where we were and where we are.
KIRK,"Are you trying to be funny, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"It would never occur to me, Captain."
KIRK,"Do you have any ideas, Spock?"
SPOCK,"We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone"
KIRK,Recommendations.
MCCOY,I have one. I recommend survival. Let's get out of here.
KIRK,"This is the Captain. We're on a difficult mission, but it's not"
KIRK,"We have no guarantees, but we have a good"
MCCOY,Sickbay to Captain Kirk.
MCCOY,"Jim, according to the life indicators, the energy levels"
KIRK,"Yes, say it, Bones."
MCCOY,"According to the life monitors, we're dying."
KIRK,Are you all right?
SCOTT,Yes.
KIRK,What was that?
SCOTT,"I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure. I was trying to recalibrate, and"
KIRK,Reverse? But that was a forward lurch. How could that happen in
SCOTT,"I don't know, sir. All I know is that the power levels are down"
KIRK,Kirk here.
SPOCK,"Sir, we are accelerating. We are being"
SPOCK,"Unknown, Captain. I suggest you order Mister Scott to give us"
KIRK,He just gave us reverse power. We lurched
SPOCK,"In that case, Captain, I would suggest we"
CHAPEL,Doctor. Life function indicators. They've
MCCOY,Stimulants. I don't know how long we can keep this up.
KIRK,"What do you think, Scotty? Forward thrust?"
SCOTT,"I don't know, sir. It goes against the rules of logic."
KIRK,"Yes, doesn't it? Well, if it doesn't work, I'll never let Spock"
SCOTT,But
KIRK,Go ahead.
SCOTT,"That's doing it, sir. We're slowing down. But we're not"
KIRK,Have one of your engineers monitor the instruments. Keep applying
CHAPEL,"Doctor, they seem to be stabilising."
MCCOY,"But at a dangerously low level. Well, we're still alive. I"
MCCOY,All I can contribute is the further we
KIRK,Engineering.
SCOTT,"As to the power levels are concerned, everything is acting"
KIRK,Spock.
SPOCK,It's logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs
KIRK,"The same thing, not the zone itself?"
SPOCK,"I would say not, Captain. The analysis of the zone indicates it"
KIRK,Maybe it's a shield of some kind. Some form of protection for
SCOTT,But what?
KIRK,"We'll find out what it is, but we'd better get out of here"
SCOTT,"Aye, Captain, but I'll reserve some for the shields in case we"
SPOCK,"I submit, Mister Scott, if we do not get out, the shields would"
KIRK,"Use whatever power is necessary to get us out of here, Scotty."
SPOCK,"Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and"
KIRK,"Well, they may not have done all of these things. You just"
SPOCK,True. It is also true they never knew what was killing them.
KIRK,Explain.
SPOCK,Vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory. The
KIRK,What was it you sensed?
SPOCK,The touch of death.
KIRK,And what do you think they felt?
SPOCK,Astonishment.
SCOTT,That ought to do it. Engineering to Captain Kirk.
KIRK,"Kirk here. What is it, Scotty?"
SCOTT,"Ready to try it when you are, sir."
KIRK,"Do we have the power to pull it off, Scotty?"
KIRK,"Stand by. All hands, this is the captain. We are slowly being"
KIRK,In the hope that it will yank us out of the
KIRK,Scotty!
KIRK,Are we still losing power?
SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"At this rate, plus the drain on all systems, two hours."
KIRK,"Maintain thrust, Scotty. While we're"
SPOCK,"I cannot say what it is, Captain, but I would say it has found"
KIRK,"Prepare to launch a probe, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir. Probe ready for launch, sir."
SPOCK,"Getting very confused readings, Captain, but this is definitely"
KIRK,Launch probe.
CHEKOV,"Probe launched, sir."
SPOCK,Probe will impact in seven point three seconds.
KYLE,"Six, five, four, three, two, one."
KIRK,Are we still in contact with the probe?
CHEKOV,"Yes, sir. Data being relayed to Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Readings coming in now, Captain. Length, approximately eleven"
KIRK,Magnification four.
CHEKOV,"Magnification four, sir."
SPOCK,"That is what is drawing us toward it, Captain. The same way it"
MCCOY,That is an amoeba.
KIRK,"Yes, I remember my basic biology, Doctor. You mean to tell me"
MCCOY,"Yes, for lack of a better term. It's a very simple form of life."
SPOCK,"Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us. I would speculate that"
KIRK,The Intrepid died of that particular virus. How is it we
SPOCK,The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was
KIRK,What about this zone of darkness? Does the organism generate it
MCCOY,It's one of the things we've got to find out. We've got to take
KIRK,"The closer we get, the faster our energy drains out. We're barely"
MCCOY,Perhaps we could risk the shuttlecraft. Perhaps with a
protective shield KIRK,I'm not sending anyone anywhere. Unmanned probes can give us the
SPOCK,"I must differ with you, Captain. We have sent unmanned probes"
MCCOY,"We could send one man in, pinpoint its vulnerable spots."
KIRK,DO you know what the odds are in coming back? I can't order a man
MCCOY,"Who said anything about an order, Jim? You've got a volunteer."
KIRK,It's a suicide mission.
SPOCK,The thing evidently has reflexes. The unmanned probe we sent in
MCCOY,"All right, so I'd know enough to go slow when we penetrated its"
SPOCK,"You have a martyr complex, Doctor. I submit that it disqualifies"
MCCOY,Do you think I intend to pass up the greatest living laboratory
since SPOCK,The Vulcans saw it first and died.
MCCOY,Just because the Vulcans failed
SPOCK,I am more capable.
KIRK,"Gentlemen, I am not taking volunteers."
MCCOY,You don't think you're going?
KIRK,I'm better qualified as a command pilot than you are.
SPOCK,"Which makes you indispensable, Captain. Further, you are not a"
MCCOY,"Jim, that organism contains chemical processes we've never seen"
We could learn more in one day SPOCK,"We don't have one day, Doctor. We have precisely one hour and"
MCCOY,Jim
SPOCK,"Captain, I"
KIRK,"Gentlemen, I'll decide."
KIRK,"Captain's personal log, stardate 4309.2. We"
SCOTT,Engineering to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,You asked me to keep you informed on the power drain. All levels
KIRK,Very well. Prepare the shuttlecraft for launching.
KIRK,Doctor McCoy will tell you what special equipment to put in. Kirk
MCCOY,"Right. I'll get a few things I need, Jim."
KIRK,"Not you, Bones. I'm sorry, Mister Spock. You're best qualified to"
SPOCK,"Do not suffer so, Doctor. This is not the"
MCCOY,"Nothing has been proven yet, Spock. The DNA code analyser will"
SPOCK,"I am familiar with the equipment, Doctor. We're wasting time."
MCCOY,"You're determined not to let me share in this, aren't you?"
SPOCK,"This is not a competition, Doctor. Whether you understand it or"
MCCOY,Vulcan dignity? How can I grant you what I don't understand?
SPOCK,Then employ one of your own superstitions. Wish me luck.
MCCOY,"Good luck, Spock."
SCOTT,All systems clear for shuttlecraft launch.
KIRK,Launch shuttlecraft.
KYLE,"Shuttlecraft away, sir."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, channel automatic telemetry directly to the"
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"Come in, Spock."
SPOCK,Power drain is enormous and growing worse.
KIRK,Chekov.
SCOTT,"Captain, h e won't have enough power to get back out if he"
KIRK,Spock.
SPOCK,We discussed that possibility earlier. But
SPOCK,Slowing now. Contact in eighteen point three seconds. Brace
KIRK,"Report, Mister Spock. Spock, report."
SPOCK,There was nothing to spare. I shall continue
MCCOY,You want to bet?
SPOCK,"I am moving slowly now, establishing course"
CHEKOV,"Sir, Mister Spock has reduced life-support"
KIRK,"Spock, save your power for the shields."
SPOCK,Calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven
SPOCK,Changes indicate the organism has stored
KIRK,You mean there'll be two of those things?
KIRK,"Spock, do you read me? Spock, do you read me?"
KIRK,"Spock, come in. Come in."
UHURA,"Contact lost, sir."
KIRK,He's alive! He's kicked it in the side to let us know.
UHURA,"Captain, I'm getting telemetry."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, telemetry analysis as it comes in."
CHEKOV,"According to Spock's telemetry information, there are over"
KIRK,"If the energy of that organism only doubles, we're dead, and"
MCCOY,"Well, all I know is, that soon there'll be two, four, eight, and"
KIRK,Spock understood when he transmitted the co-ordinates of the
SCOTT,"Captain, the pull from that organism is increasing, and the"
KIRK,How much time do we have?
SCOTT,"No more than an hour now, sir."
KIRK,Put all secondary systems on standby. Shield power has
SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,"Captain, I'm receiving a message from Mister Spock on a"
KIRK,"Put it on, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"On audio, sir."
SPOCK,I am slowly losing life support and minimal
MCCOY,How do you feel?
KIRK,What's on your mind?
MCCOY,"Spock. Is it me, Jim? Am I so sentimental that I just have to"
KIRK,"He knew the odds when he went out there, just as you did when you"
MCCOY,"It's a disease, like a virus invading the body of our galaxy."
KIRK,"Yes, it is, isn't it? How many cells does the human body have?"
MCCOY,Millions.
KIRK,"This thing, this cell, this virus. It's eleven thousand miles"
MCCOY,"Now, isn't that a thought? Here we are, antibodies of our own"
KIRK,Antibodies. Antibodies.  Bridge.
KIRK,"Scotty, how much power do we have left?"
SCOTT,"We're down to forty three percent, sir."
KIRK,What would happen if you diverted all remaining power to the
SCOTT,Cut the engine thrust? We'd be sucked into
KIRK,Exactly. Prepare to divert power on my
KIRK,Have you got something to say?
MCCOY,"Technically, no. Medically, yes. Between the stimulants and the"
KIRK,"I don't have a few minutes, Bones. Maybe none of us do. Let's go."
KIRK,"All hands, this is the captain. We're going"
KIRK,"Ready, Scotty."
SCOTT,Switching power to shields. Impulse in reserve. Cutting thrust
KYLE,Impact five seconds.
CHEKOV,"We're through, sir."
KIRK,"I believe everybody is aware of that, Mister Chekov."
UHURA,"Damage control parties report minimal damage, sir. Repairs are"
KIRK,"Very good, Lieutenant."
SCOTT,"Captain, we've only twenty six percent power reserves after"
KIRK,"Do we have impulse power, Scotty?"
SCOTT,"I saved all I could, sir, but I don't know whether we have"
KIRK,We are committed.
SCOTT,"Aye, we are, but we're committed to what? We have no power for"
MCCOY,We couldn't use it. We'd cook ourselves along with that mess of
protoplasm out there KIRK,That thing would probably like phasers. It eats power.
SCOTT,"Then what the devil, begging your pardon sir, are we doing?"
KIRK,Mister Spock was trying to tell us what to do when we lost voice
SCOTT,We can't use the power to destroy it.
KIRK,Anti-power.
MCCOY,What?
KIRK,This thing has a negative energy charge. Everything seems to work
SCOTT,"Aye, it couldn't swallow that."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, prepare a probe. Scotty, we'll need a magnetic"
SCOTT,"It's on its way, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, we'll use a timing detonator for the probe. Work"
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Helmsman, when do you estimate arrival at nucleus?"
KYLE,"Seven minutes, sir."
MCCOY,How close are you going to it?
KIRK,Point blank range. We'll implant it then back away.
MCCOY,Why? The probe has a range of
KIRK,"With the eddies and currents in that protoplasm, the probe could"
MCCOY,How long do you think you can keep taking that stuff? It'll blow
KIRK,Keep me together for another seven minutes. That's all I need.
SPOCK,"Personal log, Commander Spock, USS"
KIRK, We have arrived at
CHEKOV,"Target co-ordinates programmed, sir. Probe ready for launch."
KIRK,"Mister Scott, how much time do we have left at one hundred"
SCOTT,"Six, maybe seven minutes, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Kyle, programme fuse for seven minute delay. All"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Programming complete. Ready for launch.
KIRK,"Launch probe at zero acceleration. Forward thrust off, one tenth"
KYLE,"Forward thrust off, sir."
CHEKOV,"Probe launched, sir."
MCCOY,"Despite what Spock said, it's still plenty sensitive."
CHEKOV,"Probe confirmed. It is lodged in the nucleus, near the"
KIRK,"Mister Kyle, back us out the way we came in. Mister Chekov, a"
KYLE,"Backing out, sir."
CHEKOV,Estimate we'll be out in six point thirty seven minutes.
KIRK,Very good.
CHEKOV,"Captain, metallic substance outside the ship."
MCCOY,Spock?
KIRK,"Lieutenant, get me Spock's voice channel. Highest possible gain."
UHURA,"Go ahead, sir."
KIRK,"Spock, do you read me? Do you read me, Spock, do you read me?"
SCOTT,"Captain, we don't have enough time to do it. We only have a"
KIRK,"I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. Get two tractor beams on"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. Tractor beams on."
SPOCK,Do not risk the ship further on my behalf.
MCCOY,"Shut up, Spock! We're rescuing you."
SPOCK,"Why, thank you, Captain McCoy."
KYLE,"Almost out. We're approaching the membrane,"
KIRK,Time until explosion?
CHEKOV,"Fifty seven seconds, sir."
KIRK,"Maintaining tractor beams on shuttlecraft, Mister Scott?"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. I can't guarantee it'll hold when the warhead"
KIRK,"You may have just written our epitaph, Mister Scott."
KIRK,"Activate main viewing screen.  Mister Chekov,"
CHEKOV,"The organism is destroyed, sir. The explosion must have"
SCOTT,"Power's coming back, sir."
KIRK,Shuttlecraft?
SCOTT,"I don't know how, sir, but it's still with us."
SPOCK,Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Shuttlecraft to
KIRK,"Spock, you're alive!"
SPOCK,"Obviously, Captain. And I have some"
MCCOY,"Don't be so smart, Spock. You botched the"
KIRK,"Later, later, later. Bring the shuttlecraft aboard, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
KYLE,Prepare to receive shuttlecraft. Received shuttlecraft. Hangar
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Starbase Six. Ahead warp"
Original Airdate,"2 Feb, 1968"
MCCOY,"Yes, Jim."
MCCOY,"Oh, about another thirty minutes. I've come across some most"
KIRK,No sign of the inhabitants so far. Kirk out.
SPOCK,Large prints. The ape-like carnivore in the reports?
KIRK,"Yes, the mugato. No problem, though. Those prints are several"
SPOCK,"Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden?"
KIRK,Or so it seemed to the brash young Lieutenant Kirk on his first
SPOCK,Class M in all respects. Quite Earth-like.
KIRK,Except these people stayed in their Garden of Eden. Bows and
SPOCK,"Bows and arrows, Captain?"
KIRK,Villagers with flintlocks? That's impossible. They hadn't
SPOCK,"Captain, look."
KIRK,One of those men walking into ambush is Tyree. The friend I lived
SPOCK,"Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden."
TYREE,Villagers!
MCCOY,"Enterprise, alert! Stand by to beam up"
KIRK,"Spock? Your phaser. (it is missing, so Kirk prepares to use his"
SPOCK,"No, Captain. I can travel."
KIRK,"Beam us up, quickly."
MCCOY,"Now, Scotty. Have medics stand by."
SCOTT,"What happened, Captain?"
KIRK,Lead projectile. Primitive firearm.
BENGA, Vitalizer B.
MCCOY,"Pressure packet. Lucky his heart's where his liver should be, or"
BENGA,"Not good, sir."
MCCOY,Coranalin.
KIRK,"Bones, can you save him?"
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,On my way. Scotty. Bones?
MCCOY,"I don't know yet, Jim."
CHEKOV,"Captain, we're holding the planet between"
UHURA,"Make that definite, sir. They're sending a routine message to"
KIRK,Good. Go to Yellow Alert.
UHURA,Yellow Alert. All stations go to Yellow Alert.
KIRK,"Do you think you can keep us out of their sight, Chekov?"
CHEKOV,"I can try, Captain."
UHURA,"Message to Starbase, sir?"
KIRK,"No point in giving ourselves away, Lieutenant. Not until we find"
SCOTT,"We can hide for a while, sir, but we may have to go out of orbit"
KIRK,Kirk to Sickbay.
KIRK,"So, they've broken the treaty."
SCOTT,"Not necessarily, Captain. They have as much right to scientific"
KIRK,Research is not the Klingon way.
SCOTT,"True, but since this is a hands-off planet, how are you going to"
KIRK,"When I left there thirteen years ago, those villagers had barely"
UHURA,"On Earth, about twelve, sir."
SCOTT,"On the other hand, a flintlock would be the first firearm the"
KIRK,"Yes, I'm aware of that, Mister Scott."
CHEKOV,"And, sir, the fact Earth took twelve centuries doesn't mean"
UHURA,We've seen different development at rates on different planets.
SCOTT,"And were the Klingons behind it, why didn't they give them"
CHEKOV,Or machine guns?
UHURA,Or old-style hand lasers?
KIRK,I did not invite a debate. I'm sorry. I'm worried about Spock and
BENGA,We've no replacements for the damaged
MCCOY,Agreed. Sterilite off.
CHAPEL,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,"He'll live or die now, Jim. I don't know which. Doctor M'Benga"
KIRK,Then you and I are transporting down.
MCCOY,I can't leave Spock at this time.
KIRK,You just indicated you could. There are Klingons here. If their
MCCOY,And if that's not it?
KIRK,Then I need help. Advice I can trust as much as Spock's.
MCCOY,"I appreciate the compliment, Jim, but"
KIRK,"Bones, I'm as worried about Spock as you are, but if the Klingons"
KIRK,McCoy and I are transporting back down. Inform ship's stores that
SCOTT,"Captain, we may have to break out of orbit"
KIRK,I understand. We'll arrange a rendezvous
KIRK,Perfect. Tyree's camp's a quarter of a mile away.
MCCOY,"Want to think about it again, Jim? Starfleet's orders about this"
planet state no interference with KIRK,No interference with normal social development. I'm not only
MCCOY,I read it. Inhabitants superior in many ways to humans. Left
KIRK,Indeed. And I intend to see that they have that chance. You
MCCOY,Do I have a choice?
KIRK, Contact ship. Took full poison. Fangs.
MCCOY,"Enterprise, McCoy. Emergency. Come in. Enterprise, come in."
KIRK,They left. Out of orbit.
MCCOY," Jim, there is no antitoxin for this"
KIRK,Tyree. Some of his men. Cure.
MCCOY,Are you hill people? Do you know a hunter named Tyree? A mugato
YUTAN,Take him to the cave. I bring Tyree.
MCCOY,You and your Garden of Eden.
NONA,"We must obtain the same firesticks, husband. You could be killing"
TYREE,"Nona, enough. In time the villagers will return to their ways of"
NONA,In time? They kill your people! I am a Kahn-ut-tu woman. In all
TYREE,I took you because you cast a spell upon me.
NONA,And I have spells that help me keep you. Remember this leaf? The
TYREE,The night of madness.
NONA,"Oh, Tyree, did you really hate that madness?"
TYREE,"No, Nona. No! It brought up evil beasts from my soul."
NONA,"Only one lovely beast, Tyree, my huge, angry man."
YUTAN,Forgive me.
NONA,What is it?
YUTAN,There are strangers in our camp. One has taken the mugato bite.
NONA,Strangers?
YUTAN,"It is said the dying one is a friend of Tyree, from long ago."
NONA,That one. Bring him when his head clears.
NONA,"The stranger, where is he?"
TYREE,"Nona, where's Kirk? The cave?"
NONA,"Tyree, you wish me to save him?"
TYREE,You must. He is the one I told you of. The friend of my younger
NONA,My remedies require I know what kind of man he is. All that is
TYREE,I gave him my promise of silence. He was made my brother.
NONA,"And I am your wife, his sister. I promise silence also."
TYREE,Nona
NONA,Quickly! Or he dies.
BENGA,Don't let these low panel readings bother you. I've seen this
CHAPEL,You mean he's conscious?
BENGA,"Well, in a sense. He knows we're here and what we're saying,"
CHAPEL,A good nurse always treats her patients that way. It proves
TYREE,I am Tyree.
NONA,And I'm Tyree's woman.
TYREE,It is Kirk. She will cure him.
MCCOY,What's that?
NONA,A mahko root.
MCCOY,A plant? It moves.
NONA,"For those who know where to find it, how to use it, how to pick"
NONA,Take this of my soul. This of my soul. Thine own. Into thine.
KIRK,Bones. I had the strangest dream.
MCCOY,"How do you feel, Jim?"
KIRK,"Tired. Very tired. You did a fine job, Bones. I think I'll sleep."
MCCOY,I want to thank you for saving his life. (Nona's hand is healed
NONA,Our blood has passed through the mahko root together. Our souls
TYREE,She must sleep also.
MCCOY,He is hers?
TYREE,"When a man and woman are joined in this manner, he can refuse"
MCCOY,Jim.
KIRK,Bones. What are you doing here?  Tyree.
TYREE,"Yes, James! James, it's good to see you."
KIRK,What am I doing here? A mugato bite! I remember. I told him to
NONA,"I am a kahn-ut-tu, Captain. I cured you."
TYREE,"My wife, Nona."
KIRK,"Yes, of course. I should've guessed. Congratulations. Tyree, we"
NONA,Good. It is past time to plan.
TYREE,"Much has happened since you left, James. Come, we'll speak of"
NONA,And of things to be done.
TYREE,Come.  We will
CHAPEL,The readings are beginning to fluctuate.
BENGA,Just as they should. This is Doctor M'Benga. There will be
CHAPEL,"Yes, Doctor."
BENGA,"After you've called me, if he speaks, do whatever he says."
CHAPEL,Do whatever he says?
BENGA,"Yes. That's clear enough, isn't it?"
TYREE,The firesticks first appeared nearly a year
KIRK,You say they make the firesticks themselves? How can you be sure?
TYREE,I've looked into their village. I have seen it being done.
MCCOY,Have you seen any strangers among the villagers?
TYREE,Strangers? No.
KIRK,Can you take us to their village while it's still dark?
TYREE,"Yes, but the mugatos travel at night also. You killed one. Its"
KIRK, You've seen how these work.
NONA,"I've seen them also, and I know you have many ways to make your"
MCCOY,Many ways? What else does she know about us?
NONA,Tyree has told me much of you. Do not blame him. It was the price
KIRK,We're simply strangers from
NONA,"From one of the lights in the sky, and you have ways as far above"
TYREE,You will not speak of this to others.
NONA,I will not if I am made to understand. Teach me. There's an old
KIRK,I am grateful.
MCCOY,A splendid custom if not carried to extremes.
KIRK,"We once were as you are, Spears, arrows. There came a time when"
NONA,Some men never grow.
KIRK,Perhaps not as fast or in the way another thinks he should. But
NONA,You must let the villagers destroy us? You will not help your
TYREE,No! I said I will not kill!
NONA,We must fight or die! Is dying better? You would let him die when
TYREE,You will help in ways she does not understand. I have faith in
MCCOY,"What's bothering you, Jim? If we find the Klingons have helped"
KIRK,That's what's bothering me. The something we may have to do.
TYREE,The guard. We must wait.
KIRK,"Tyree, supposing you had to fight? What then?"
MCCOY,"Jim, this man believes in the same thing we believe in. That"
KIRK,Tyree?
TYREE,Now. Come.
KIRK,The gun. Ammunition. Doctor.
KRELL,"You are late, my friend Apella."
APELLA,A quarrel by my people. A division of some skins and a hill
KRELL,Give her to the man who killed the most of her people. The
APELLA,What?
KRELL,A way to shoot further and straighter.
MCCOY,"Jim. Coal for forge, sulphur for gun powder."
KIRK,Let's take a look inside.
KIRK,"Well, here's your forge. People's exhibit number one. A chrome"
MCCOY, This pig iron is almost carbon-free. That village
KIRK,Make recorder and scanner tapes of everything.
MCCOY,Right. It's a pity we can't include a live Klingon. That'd just
APELLA,I thought my people would grow tired of killing. But you were

KIRK,Bones!
KIRK, Move! Fast!
SPOCK,Nurse.
CHAPEL,Yes?
SPOCK,Hit me. The pain will help me to consciousness. Hit me.
CHAPEL,Hit you? No! I can't
SPOCK,"Blast you, strike me! If I don't regain consciousness soon, it"
SPOCK,Again. Continue. The pain will help me to consciousness.
SCOTT," What are you doing, woman?"
CHAPEL,Leave me alone!
SCOTT,Have you gone daft?
CHAPEL,Mister Spock needs me! Let go!
SPOCK,"That will be quite enough. Thank you, doctor."
BENGA,"Please, release her."
SCOTT,What's this all about?
SPOCK,"She was doing as I requested, Mister Scott. A Vulcan form of"
BENGA,"As you saw, they must wait until the last possible moment then"

SPOCK,"Thank you, nurse. I'm quite fully recovered."

MCCOY,"Jim, I want to talk to you."
KIRK,"Not here, Bones. In the cave. Yutan, your turn."
MCCOY,Do I have to say it? It's not bad enough
KIRK,Exactly. Each side receives the same knowledge and the same type
MCCOY,"Have you gone out of your mind? Yes, maybe you have. Tyree's"
KIRK,Superstition.
MCCOY,Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants?
KIRK,Is it? She wants superior weapons. That's the one thing neither
MCCOY,"Jim, that means you're condemning this whole planet to a war"
KIRK,"All right, Doctor! All right. Say I'm wrong. Say I'm drugged. Say"
MCCOY,I don't have a solution. But furnishing them firearms is
KIRK,"Bones, do you remember the twentieth century brush wars on the"
MCCOY,"Yes, I remember. It went on bloody year after bloody year."
KIRK,"What would you have suggested, that one side arm its friends with"
MCCOY,And if the Klingons give their side even more?
KIRK,Then we arm our side with exactly that much more. A balance of
MCCOY,And what about your friend Tyree? Will he understand this
KIRK,No. Probably not. But I'm going to have to try and make him

SPOCK,The Klingons?

SPOCK,Stand by to signal the captain.
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,Nona. Pardon me.
NONA,You are here because I wished you here.
KIRK,Oh? I thought it was my idea.
NONA,Yes. They always believe they come of free will. Tyree thought
KIRK,Nona
NONA,Can you smell this fragrance? Some find it pleasing.
KIRK,I'd like to talk to you.
NONA,Again. Some find it soothing. Yes.
KIRK,I would like
NONA,Happy. Yes. You feel good.
KIRK,"I feel dizzy. Yes, you are lovely. You're beautiful."
NONA,Kiss me.
MCCOY,"Where's Captain Kirk? Tyree, the firestick. Where is it?"
TYREE,There! I left it there.
MCCOY,That's a fine thing to leave lying around. Show us where it is.
TYREE,I do not want it.
MCCOY,Jim? Jim. Who hit you?
KIRK,Nona.
NONA,I bring you victory for Apella!
NONA,Take me to him. He will have the strength to use this new weapon.
NONA,"Touch me again, and this small box will kill you."
KIRK,"No, no. I'm all right. My phaser. She took it."
NONA,This weapon I bring you is far greater than
TYREE,Nona!
MCCOY,She's dead.
TYREE,"I want more of these, Kirk. Many more! Yutan, two of those who"

SPOCK,"Evidently, Captain."
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, you have the conn."

MCCOY,But you once had a body of some type?
SARGON,"A body much as yours, my children, although our minds were"
KIRK,That's twice you've referred to us as my children.
SARGON,"Because it is possible you are our descendants, Captain Kirk."

MCCOY,"And destroy them, just as you're burning that one up now."
KIRK,I will return your captain to you before the body limit has been
SPOCK,"Our bodies, Sargon, for what purpose?"
KIRK,To build. To build humanoid robots. We must borrow your bodies

MCCOY,And what if we should decide against you?
SCOTT,You're going to what? Are they all right in
MCCOY,No comment.
KIRK,A simple transference. Their minds and ours.
MCCOY,Quite simple. Happens every day.
KIRK,"Scotty, I need your approval, too. Since you'll work with them,"
ll be MCCOY,It all seems rather indecent to me.
MULHALL,"I'm not so certain of that, Doctor. It is scientifically"
SPOCK,"Once inside their mechanical bodies, engineer, they can leave"
KIRK,"Bones, they'll show us medical advances, miracles you never"
SCOTT,Ach! You're joking.
SPOCK,"No, he's not."
MCCOY,"They're giants, and we're insects beside them. They could"
KIRK,They selected us as the most compatible bodies.
MCCOY,"What's your attitude on that, Doctor?"
MULHALL,"Well, if we all agree, I'm willing to host Thalassa's mind."
SCOTT,A starship engine the size of a walnut? That's impossible. But I

KIRK,"They used to say if man could fly, he'd have wings. But he did"
MCCOY,The extreme power of the alien mind will drive the heart action
CHAPEL,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,"Well, I guess we're as ready as we'll ever be, Jim."
KIRK,"Ready, Sargon."
KIRK, The transference is complete.
CHAPEL,"Metabolic rate is double and rising, Doctor."
SPOCK," Hello. Oh, you are a lovely"
CHAPEL,Thank you.
SPOCK,You're welcome.
MULHALL, I'd forgotten what it felt like even to breathe again.
KIRK,Here. In this body.
MULHALL,"I am not displeased, my husband. Your body is not unlike that"
KIRK,"And I too am pleased, beloved."
MULHALL,After so long. So very long.
KIRK,Kiss.
SPOCK,"This is an excellent body, Doctor. I seem to have received the"
MCCOY,"Vulcans worship peace above all, Henoch."
SPOCK,"Yes, of course, Just as we do, Doctor."
MCCOY,Nurse!
CHAPEL,Doctor?

SPOCK,"It will be unnecessary, Doctor. This Vulcan body is accustomed"

KIRK,We will vacate at once until you can administer a metabolic

SPOCK,"I'll prepare the formula, Sargon."
KIRK,"Henoch, your condition?"
SPOCK,I can continue in this body for several hours.
KIRK,Fortunate. We will vacate at once.
SPOCK,This woman will assist me.  You will take me to your

MCCOY,"It was close, Jim. You both barely got back alive. Unless the"
SPOCK,Now. this formula will reduce the heart

SPOCK,This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa. And this one you will

SPOCK,This one you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in
CHAPEL,This hypo does not contain the same formula.
SPOCK,"No, that's correct. But since I will arrange for you to"
CHAPEL,"Without the same formula, Captain Kirk will die."
SPOCK,What were you saying?
CHAPEL,I. I was. I wanted to say something. I've forgotten what it
SPOCK,"Yes. Well, you were about to say that you watched me prepare the"
CHAPEL,"Yes, that, that was it. I will inform Doctor McCoy that each is"
SPOCK,"Very good. You see, Sargon would not permit me to keep this"
MCCOY,"As planned, the construction of android"

KIRK,I remember. You held my hand like this.
KIRK,I think it best not to remember so well.

KIRK,"Our minds will have survived. And as androids, we can move among"

KIRK,Nothing. Our next injection will renovate me. Do not be

CHAPEL,"You'll find them excellent, Doctor. Well within normal."
MCCOY,"Is something wrong, Miss Chapel?"
CHAPEL,"Er, yes. I, er, I had something to say. I can't seem to"
MCCOY,Regarding our patients?
CHAPEL,Yes. That must be it. I am so pleased the way they are
MCCOY,"You look tired, Miss Chapel. Perhaps you'd care for me to"
CHAPEL,"Tired? Well, not at all, Doctor. Thank you for asking."
MULHALL,Thank you. Have you prepared the negaton hydracoils for the

MULHALL,That would be highly inefficient.
SCOTT,"I tell you, lady, this thing won't work."

SPOCK,"A thousand-year prison, Thalassa. And when it wears out we'll"
MULHALL,"They're not ours, Henoch."
SPOCK,"When you awoke in this body, Thalassa, you said how good it was"
MULHALL,No. I'm beginning to hate it.
KIRK,Sickbay.
KIRK,"Sargon here, McCoy. I'm in your deck six briefing room."
MULHALL,"Sargon, what is it?"
KIRK,Nothing of importance. Fatigue perhaps.
MULHALL,Henoch's formula.
KIRK,Yes. I wanted to be certain there was no error. Formula is
MULHALL,"In time, a host body will become accustomed to us, husband."
KIRK,"That will take months, perhaps years. We haven't that choice,"
MULHALL,"Husband. Feel the touch of my hand, husband."
KIRK,"No, beloved. If we torment ourselves"
MULHALL,Beloved. What will that word mean to a machine?
KIRK,Our thoughts will intertwine.
MULHALL,"Will they, husband? Will they intertwine like this? Can two"
MCCOY,Hypo.
MULHALL,"Doctor, help him!"
MCCOY,He's dead.
NURSE,"All his vital organs are now working, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Yes, we can keep them going for a few weeks, or a month. For all"
MULHALL,"Why pretend to work on that thing, Henoch? You know you never"
SPOCK,"This is your new home, Thalassa. Once occupied, I'll add female"
MULHALL,No!
SPOCK,You have no excuse to keep the real body any longer. Sargon
MULHALL,I cannot live in that thing.
MULHALL,Doctor.
MCCOY,Yes?
MULHALL,Would you like to save your Captain Kirk?
MCCOY,But you said that was impossible.
MULHALL,We have many powers Sargon did not permit us to use. He
MCCOY,"I see. And Henoch intends to keep Spock's body, of course."
MULHALL,Henoch's plans are his own affair. I wish only to exist in
MCCOY,If you're asking my approval
MULHALL,I require only your silence. Only you and I will know that
MCCOY,Neither Jim nor I can trade a body we don't own. It happens to
MULHALL,Who you hardly know. Almost a stranger to you.
MCCOY,I will not peddle flesh. I'm a physician.
MULHALL,"A physician? In contrast to what we are, you are a prancing,"
MULHALL,Stop!  Sargon was right. The temptations
MULHALL,Sargon? Where are you? I thought you destroyed by Henoch.
SARGON,"I have power even Henoch does not suspect, beloved."
MULHALL,"Yes. Yes, I see. I understand. Just as we would have placed"
CHAPEL,Doctor.
MULHALL,"Doctor, leave us. Sargon has a plan. We have much work to do."
MCCOY,This is Sickbay. Get me
MCCOY,"Nurse Chapel, what in the devil?"
MCCOY,Jim? Are you all right?
KIRK,"Yes, I'm fine, Bones."
MCCOY,Thalassa?
MULHALL,"She is now with Sargon, Doctor. I'm Ann Mulhall, back in my"
MCCOY,"Jim, the receptacles. Spock's consciousness was in one of them."
KIRK,It was necessary.
MCCOY,What are you talking about? There is no Spock to return to his
KIRK,"Bones, prepare a hypo. The fastest, deadliest poison to Vulcans."
SPOCK,"Must I make an example of you, too, Helm?"
SPOCK,"Pain, Captain. And you, my dear?"
SPOCK,"Fortunately, Doctor, I know every thought of every mind around"
SPOCK,"Fools. I'll simply transfer to another place, another body."
SPOCK,"Sargon! No, Sargon, please. Let me. Let me transfer."
KIRK,Spock. My friend Spock. If there'd only been another way.
MCCOY,Jim.
KIRK,You're alive.
MCCOY,There was enough poison in that hypo to kill ten Vulcans.
MCCOY,Sargon.
SPOCK,"It seems, Doctor, the injection was only enough to cause"
KIRK,"But your vessel was destroyed, too. Where was your consciousness"
SPOCK,"The place Henoch would least suspect, Captain."
CHAPEL,"That is why I was summoned into Sickbay, Doctor. Mister Spock's"
KIRK,"Is there any way we can help you, Sargon?"
SARGON,"Yes, my son. You can allow Thalassa and me to share your bodies"
MULHALL,"Oblivion together does not frighten me, beloved. Promise we'll"
KIRK,"I promise, beloved."
MULHALL,Together forever.
KIRK,Forever beloved. Forever.
KIRK,"Well, I'm sure that Sargon appreciated your co-operation, Doctor"
MULHALL,"Yes. I was happy to co-operate, Captain."
CHAPEL,It was beautiful.

UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."

KIRK,"I don't know, Bones. We're here to find out what's happened"
SPOCK,"I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text"
KIRK,I knew him very well. He was my instructor at the Academy.
SPOCK,What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as
UHURA,"Captain, no response on any Starfleet channel."
CHEKOV,Spacecraft approaching from inner planet.
KIRK,From Ekos?
SPOCK,"Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship. Zeons do have a crude"

CHEKOV,Phasers ready.

CHEKOV,"Two thousand kilometres, closing fast."

SPOCK,"According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike"
KIRK,We've run into a far more serious problem than the disappearance
KIRK,Insert the transponders. Make one low pass to communication range

SPOCK,Mid-twentieth century Earth. The nation state called Nazi
KIRK,How could this have happened? The chances of another planet
SPOCK,"Virtually impossible, Captain, yet the evidence is quite clear."
KIRK,"You look quite well for a man who's been utterly destroyed,"
KIRK,That's John Gill. The Fuhrer?
SPOCK,Fascinating.
SOLDIER,"You, Zeons! What kind of monsters are the Zeons sending"
KIRK,You're right. He's not one of us.
SOLDIER,What do you mean?
KIRK,Look at him.
KIRK,"Spock, take his uniform."
SPOCK,"You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, Captain?"
KIRK,If John Gill is the Fuhrer it would seem the logical approach.
SPOCK,"That's very well taken, Captain."
KIRK,That helmet covers a multitude of sins.
OFFICER,"Lieutenant, what have we here? A Zeon?"
SPOCK,Yes. Obviously he's not one of us. I captured him. Is that not
OFFICER,"With all Zeon pigs, Lieutenant."
SPOCK,Take charge of him.
OFFICER,"With pleasure. Today we have a surprise planned for you, Zeon."
SPOCK,"Your uniform, Captain."
KIRK,"Yes, it's a shame yours isn't as attractive as mine. Gestapo, I"
SPOCK,Quite correct. You should make a very convincing Nazi.

MAJOR,Lieutenant! Your helmet. Remove it.
KIRK,We have urgent business with the Fuhrer.
MAJOR,"Lieutenant, remove your helmet."

MAJOR,"Ah, Chairman Eneg. Your Excellency, I am honoured. I've been"
captured in ENEG,I've had a full report. You are not from Zeon.
SPOCK,Obviously.
ENEG,Where do you come from?
KIRK,I'll explain when I see the Fuhrer.
ENEG,What is your business with the Fuhrer?
KIRK,I'll discuss that only with him.

KIRK,Were they like this when you first came?
ISAK,"Warlike, yes, but not vicious. That started when the Nazi"
SPOCK,That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival.
ISAK,"When they've destroyed us here, they will attack our planet."
KIRK,Do you know the plan of this building?
ISAK,Why?
KIRK,"If we can get to the SS weapons laboratory, get our weapons back,"
ISAK,Why should you be interested in saving Zeons?
KIRK,"We must get our communicators, contact the ship."
SPOCK,"Captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door, and the guard"
KIRK,The transponders.
SPOCK,Yes.
KIRK,"And a way to shed some light on the gloom, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Of course. The rubindium crystals in the transponders.
ISAK,Are you trying to kill yourselves?
KIRK,I know it's there. McCoy put it in. There. Do you have the
SPOCK,"Yes. We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance,"
SPOCK,"Twenty seven point two millimetres would be, approximately,"
ISAK,"What is it you're making, some kind of radio?"
KIRK,"No, not a radio. The power from this light is very low."
SPOCK,"Yes. To reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform."
KIRK,"I would be honoured, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to"
KIRK,"Oh, Mister Spock, the guard did a professional job on my back."
SPOCK,"Yes, of course, Captain. You realise that the aim will of course"
KIRK, I don't care if you hit the broad side of a barn. Just
SPOCK,"Captain, why should I aim at such a structure?"
KIRK,"Never mind, Spock. Just get on with the job."
KIRK,"Oh, my goodness. Beautiful. Oh, Spock Spock! "
KIRK,Help! Help! I'll talk! I'll talk! I can't stand it anymore! I'll
KIRK,"Guard, I'll talk. I'll talk. The pain"
ISAK,Take me with you. Give me a chance to fight them.
SPOCK,"May I remind you, we did not intend to fight."
ISAK,"Take me with you, or you'll never find the laboratory."
KIRK,"Take him with us, Mister Spock. He's got a point. He's our guide."
KIRK,Which is the laboratory door?
ISAK,The end of the hall.
KIRK,"All right, Zeon pigs, move.  Zeon"
KIRK,"Move, move."
KIRK, Cover the door.
KIRK,"Here they are. The communicators, disassembled. Can you get one"
SPOCK,Possibly.
ISAK,Who are you people?
SPOCK,I do not see them.
ISAK,Where do you come from?
KIRK, The alien pistols have been sent to Gestapo
KIRK,"You Zeons, for peaceful people, are pretty thorough."
ISAK,"Yes. With this uniform, we can steal a car, get out of the"
KIRK,We came for John Gill.
SPOCK,"Captain, without phasers, and until we are able to communicate"
KIRK,"All right, Mister Spock. You've made your point. Get into the"
KIRK,"Hunting's good. We've caught so many Zeons, we've got to dump"
DAVOD,Who's with you?
ISAK,It's all right. They helped me escape from the prison. I owe them
ABROM,"Isak, what is all this?"
ISAK,"Abrom! Abrom, thank God you're well. This is my brother. They"
ABROM,Why were you in their prison?
KIRK,I was trying to see the Fuhrer.
ABROM,The Fuhrer?
KIRK,"If I can see him, there may be a way of stopping this insanity."
ISAK,"Abrom, I owe them my life."
ABROM,"Isak, Uletta is dead. Shot down in the streets."
ISAK,She would've been my wife.
ABROM,She lived for five hours while they walked past her and spat on
ISAK,"If we adopt the ways of the Nazis, we're as bad as the Nazis."
SPOCK,"Captain, I suggest the most profitable use of our time would be"
ABROM,This way.
SPOCK,"By using parts from both, I've completed one communicator. I do"
KIRK,The Enterprise won't be within range for another hour.
DARAS,"Over there. Against the wall, all of you."
KIRK,The girl on the viewscreen.
SPOCK,The one receiving a medal.
KIRK,Daras.
DARAS,"Quiet. Hands in the air, Zeon swine. So you're the three who"
KIRK,I must see the Fuhrer. It's urgent.
DARAS,Urgent? I'll bet it is.
ABROM,I alone am responsible for what happens here.
DARAS,Do you know what we do to responsible Zeons?
DARAS,Now we finish the job.
ISAK,"Stop, Nazis. After you've killed the last of us off, what do you"
ISAK,"Don't shoot. Don't shoot, please."
ABROM,"No, wait.  No more. You've proved they're on our side."
ISAK,"Now, please forgive us, but we had to be absolutely certain."
ABROM,"Yes. If we had taken you into our confidence, we could've"
ISAK,"The Gestapo methods are frighteningly efficient. We must be very,"
SPOCK,"This young lady is a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland. We saw her"
DARAS,I'm an Ekosian fighting the terrible thing that's happened to my
KIRK,Melakon?
ABROM,The Deputy Fuhrer. He's taken over.
DARAS,"My father denounced me, making it appear like I'd betrayed him."
KIRK,How could this have seemed right to John Gill?
ABROM,Who?
KIRK,"John Gill, your Fuhrer. He's one of our people."
ABROM,And what is your people?
KIRK,I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise. This
DARAS,You mean that the Fuhrer is an alien?
SPOCK,That is correct.
DARAS,"I grew up to admire him, later to hate and despise everything he"
s an alien sent here to destroy us KIRK,"That was not his mission, ever. He was sent here to observe, not"
ISAK,"It's impossible. Even if this were another time, it still would"
KIRK,Maximum security. Is he so afraid?
ISAK,"There are many of us, both Ekosians and younger Zeons, who would"
KIRK,I don't understand what's going on here. This goes against every
DARAS,He makes a speech tonight from the Chancellery. All the top
KIRK,Will you be there?
DARAS,Of course. As a symbol of the proper attitude toward the
SPOCK,"As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the"
DARAS,"Only the top, most trusted, officials will be allowed in. The"
ISAK,I'm afraid it will be a formal declaration of war against Zeon.
KIRK,You must get us in there.
DARAS,It would be suicide.
ISAK,Well it's a risk living at all the way things are going. If the
DARAS,"You, a Zeon? You expect to get into the Chancellery?"
ISAK,It's even more my fight than yours.
KIRK,Lights.
GUARD,"You, what is your business here?"
KIRK,Get me some lights on her.
GUARD,It's Party Secretary Daras.
DARAS, The Fuhrer's special documentary
KIRK,Excuse me.
SPOCK,"Captain, I'm beginning to understand why you"
KIRK,"Very good, Spock. We may make a human of you yet."
KIRK,Let's go.
KIRK,Lights.  Thank you. Where does the Fuhrer
DARAS,"He doesn't. They watch him on the big screen. There, at the end"
KIRK,They've got the booth curtained off. Bring that light to the side
DARAS,"There, at the end of the corridor. You're not going to try to"
KIRK,We're going to try.
ISAK,"Sir, is this light better here?"
KIRK,Good.
ISAK,"If you distract the guard long enough, I can get a machine gun."
KIRK,"We're here to get John Gill, and alive, not for your personal"
KIRK,"Lights, please. Gentlemen, this is for the"
DARAS,We're documenting the men responsible for
KIRK,"Smile, gentlemen. There will be more coverage later. Thank you"
ISAK,"So, what have we accomplished? You should"
SPOCK,"Captain, it was John Gill, but he never moved. Never once looked"
KIRK,"Yes, well, that may be part of the plan, the semi-divine"
SPOCK,Or a deep psychosis.
KIRK,It may be simpler than that. He may be drugged. We need McCoy. Is
DARAS,Send for?
KIRK,It takes too long to explain. Any place will do.
ISAK,The cloakroom?
SPOCK,"It may not have the range it had. In fact, it may not work at"
KIRK,"Think positively, Spock."
SPOCK,"Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. Come in, Enterprise."
KIRK,Captain here. Put McCoy on.
KIRK,We've having difficulty. Patch historical computer into uniform
ENEG,Search the building.
KIRK,"We found John Gill. At least, we've seen him. He may be drugged,"
KIRK,What is it?
DARAS,"Isak just heard two security men. They picked up your broadcast,"
SPOCK,"If there's going to be a delay in transporting the doctor, I"
suggest we cancel our KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise. What's happening up there?
UHURA,Doctor McCoy is having difficulty with that
KIRK,Send him down naked if you have to. Kirk out.
DARAS,It's true. I only half-believed what you said.
MCCOY,Stupid computer made a mistake in the measurements. The right
SPOCK,"There is a logical way to proceed, Doctor. Point your toe, apply"
KIRK,"This is Doctor McCoy, our Chief Medical Officer. Daras, secretary"
MCCOY,How do you do? What in blazes is this?
DARAS,Chairman Eneg.
KIRK,The Colonel is drunk. He's had a little too much to drink.
ENEG,I see.
KIRK,"Yes, he thought he would embarrass the Fuhrer."
SPOCK,Yes. A doctor should have more pride.
ENEG,You were right to conceal him. There's a spy in this building
ALL,Hail the Fuhrer.
SPOCK,"Captain, I do not understand how he failed to recognise us."
KIRK,"Nor do I, but luck is something you also fail to recognise,"
SPOCK,True. I shall reconsider.
DARAS,The Fuhrer's speech.
KIRK,Let's go.
ALL,Hail the Fuhrer! Hail the Fuhrer! Hail the Fuhrer! Hail the
GILL,Ekosians. The job ahead is difficult. It requires courage and
KIRK,Watch his mouth.
GILL,"If we fulfill our own greatness, that will all be ended. Working"
together SPOCK,"Captain, the speech follows no logical pattern."
KIRK,Random sentences strung together.
GILL,Will at times be difficult.
MCCOY,"He looks drugged, Jim. Almost at a cataleptic state."
GILL,"To reach our goal, And we will reach that goal."
MCCOY,I have to have a close look at him.
GILL,must be decisive. Every thought directed toward a goal. This
KIRK," Gentlemen, I want a picture of"
KIRK,It's locked. Keys.
ALL,Hail the Fuhrer!
MELAKON,Hail the Fuhrer!
ALL,Hail the Fuhrer!
MELAKON,"The Fuhrer has given us our orders, and we pledge him our"
ALL,Death to Zeon! Death to Zeon!
MCCOY,"Definitely drugged, almost comatose."
SPOCK,What drug?
MCCOY,"I can't identify it without a medi-comp. Without knowing, an"
KIRK,Is there anything you do?
MCCOY,"I can give him a general stimulant, but it would be risky."
KIRK,Take the risk.
ISAK,There's no reaction. Whatever you gave him isn't working.
KIRK,"Bones, increase the dosage."
MCCOY,I'm working in the dark. I could kill him.
DARAS,"If they find us here, we'll all be killed."
MELAKON,"Ten minutes ago, on our Fuhrer's orders,"
DARAS,It's begun. It's finally begun.
MCCOY,The stimulant's working.
MCCOY,He's reaching a level of consciousness. It's almost like he's in
KIRK,"Spock, try to get through to him with a mind probe. If you can't,"
MELAKON,This is the time of destiny. Hail victory!
ALL,Hail victory! Hail victory! Hail victory!
DARAS,"There's one chance left. If you'd use the weapons you have, you"
KIRK,That would mean the death of thousands of Ekosian spacemen.
ISAK,"Many of my friends are aboard that ship, many of the Underground."
DARAS,"Yes, but against those thousands are millions of innocent Zeon"
KIRK,"We could save Zeon, but what about Ekos?"
SPOCK,Captain. I have created a condition in which Gill cannot
KIRK,"Well done, Spock. They've kept what's left of him as a figure"
SPOCK,"Quite correct. For the last few years, the real power has been"
KIRK,"Gill. Gill, why did you abandon your mission? Why did you"
GILL,Planet fragmented. Divided. Took lesson from Earth history.
KIRK,But why Nazi Germany? You studied history. You knew what the
GILL,Most efficient state Earth ever knew.
SPOCK,"Quite true, Captain. That tiny country, beaten, bankrupt,"
KIRK,"But it was brutal, perverted, had to be destroyed at a terrible"
SPOCK,"Perhaps Gill felt that such a state, run benignly, could"
KIRK,"Why, Gill? Why?"
GILL,Worked. At first it worked. Then Melakon began take over. Used
KIRK,"Gill. Gill. Gill, can you hear me? You've got to tell those"
MCCOY,"He's still alive, but the drug they use is too strong. If I give"
him another shot KIRK,"Bones, give him another shot!"
MCCOY,I don't dare.
ISAK, Guards.
KIRK,"We've run out of time, Bones. No, wait. "
ISAK,"For the second time in one day, Daras is a hero to the"
KIRK,She captured a Zeon spy that was attempting to assassinate the
ENEG,Guards.
ISAK,"Yes, let us make an example of this traitor once and for all."
KIRK,We'll make a present of him to Melakon.
ISAK,"Chairman Eneg, this spy must be taken to Melakon."
ENEG,Pass them on my responsibility.
ISAK,Eneg is one of us.
KIRK,Stay close to Spock. Stall for time. And hope.
MELAKON,What is this?
ISAK,"A spy, Excellency."
DARAS,A rare prize. The Deputy Fuhrer can see this is no ordinary
MELAKON,"No, not a Zeon, definitely not."
KIRK,"Professor Gill, can you hear me? You've got to speak. You've got"
DARAS,The Deputy Fuhrer's an authority on the
MELAKON,Very difficult. Note the sinister eyes and the malformed ears.
KIRK,Professor. Professor! You've got to talk! You've got to tell them
MELAKON,"Note the low forehead, denoting stupidity."
GILL,People. People of Ekos.
MELAKON,Go to the booth. See to the Fuhrer at once. He's ill. Turn off
GILL,Hear me.
MELAKON,I suggest we leave and let our Fuhrer rest.
GILL,Only one evil man. Melakon
ENEG,"Wait, soldier. There's been enough killing. Now we'll start to"
GILL, I was wrong.
KIRK,"You did that, Professor. You told them in time."
GILL,Even historians fail to learn from history. They repeat the same
SPOCK,"Is he dead, Captain?"
KIRK,Dead.
ISAK,For so long I've prayed for this. Now I'm sorry.
KIRK,So is he.
ISAK,You've given us all a new chance.
ENEG,"Thank you, but go now. We must do the rest."
DARAS,"Eneg and I will go on the air, offer a new way for our people."
ENEG,"It is time to stop the bloodshed, to bury our dead."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, I think the planet is in good"
SPOCK,"Indeed, Captain. With the union of two cultures, this system"
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Beam us aboard.
SPOCK,"Captain, I never will understand humans. How"
KIRK,He drew the wrong conclusion from history. The problem with the
MCCOY,"What he's saying, Spock, is that a man who holds that much"
SPOCK,"Thank you, Doctor. I was able to gather the meaning."
MCCOY,It also proves another Earth saying. Absolute power corrupts
SPOCK,"Yes. Earthmen like Ramses, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler,"
MCCOY,"Spock, you obviously don't understand"
SPOCK,"Obviously, Doctor, you fail to accept"
KIRK,"Gentlemen. Gentlemen, we've just been through one civil war."
Original Airdate,"23 Feb, 1968"
SPOCK,"No life form readings, Captain. Continuing scan."
MCCOY,"Well, somebody sent a distress call."
KIRK,No sign of the spaceship. No sign of debris.
SPOCK,"I am getting readings on small metallic objects, Captain. It is"
KIRK,But where are they?
THOMPSON,"Captain, I'm getting a reading now. Two human forms at"
SPOCK,Confirmed.
KIRK,"I'm Captain James T. Kirk, of the starship Enterprise. We came in"
ROJAN,"It was very kind of you to respond so quickly, captain. Now you"
KIRK,"You have a very strange sense of humour, Mister"
ROJAN,I am Rojan of Kelva. I am your commander from this moment on.
KIRK,Stay there.
THOMPSON,Captain.
KIRK,It's all right.
SPOCK,Interesting. A neural field?
ROJAN,Yes. Radiating from a central projector.
KIRK,What do you want?
ROJAN,"Your ship, Captain Kirk. It will serve us well in the long"
KIRK,Voyage? Where?
ROJAN,"To your neighbouring galaxy, which you call Andromeda."
KIRK,Andromeda? Why?
ROJAN,It is our home.
SPOCK,What brings you here?
ROJAN,"Within ten millennia, high radiation levels in our galaxy will"
KIRK,"Well, sorry. This galaxy is already occupied."
ROJAN,"Captain, you think you are unconquerable and your ship"
CHEKOV,Something penetrating from the planet.
SCOTT,Increase power to shields.
CHEKOV,"It's dead, sir. All major power disabled."
SCOTT,Sound Red Alert.
UHURA,"Red Alert. All personnel, man your battle stations. Go to Red"
SCOTT,"Engineering, come in."
UHURA,"Life support, come in."
HANAR,"Drea, Tomar, report."
DREA,"Life support control, secure."
TOMAR,Engineering is secure.
HANAR,"Rojan, Hanar here."
ROJAN,"Report, Hanar."
ROJAN,Proceed with your orders.
KIRK,"What's the point of capturing my ship? Even at maximum warp, the"
ROJAN,"Captain, we will modify its engines, in order to produce"
THOMPSON,You made a voyage of three hundred years?
KELINDA,Our ships were of multigeneration design. We were born in the
ROJAN,And our mission will be completed by a commander who is my
KIRK,What happened to your ship?
ROJAN,There is an energy barrier at the rim of your galaxy.
KIRK,"Yes, I know. We've been there."
ROJAN,We managed to break through it with great difficulty. Our ship
SPOCK,Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy?
ROJAN,No form of transmission can penetrate the barrier.
KIRK,"Rojan, there's no reason to do this by force. Let's take your"
ROJAN,We do not colonize. We conquer. We rule. There's no other way
MCCOY,"In other words, the galaxy isn't big enough for both of us."
KIRK,The Federation has handled foreign invasions before.
ROJAN,"Captain, we can control the Federation as easily as we can"
HANAR,"All is proceeding according to plan, Rojan."
ROJAN,"Kelinda, take them to the holding area. We'll keep you and your"
KELINDA,Move there.
HANAR,Tomar has examined the ship. The modifications are underway.
ROJAN,"Space again, Hanar. I do not think we could have kept our sanity"
HANAR,It is an undisciplined environment. One cannot control it. Yet
ROJAN,"Yes, but disturbing. These shells in which we've encased"
HANAR,"Since the ship was designed to sustain these forms, we have"
ROJAN,At least we'll be away from all of this openness. This is too
SPOCK,"Fascinating material. Similar to diburnium, but considerably"
KIRK,All right. We can't break out. There must be another way.
THOMPSON,"Captain, what do they want from us. What kind of people are"
KIRK,That's a very good question.
MCCOY,They registered as human.
SPOCK,"No, Doctor. More than that. They registered as perfect human"
KIRK,"Spock, what are the odds in such absolute duplication of life"
SPOCK,The chances are very much against it.
GUARD,Captain. 
KIRK,They have the paralysis field. Rojan mentioned something about a
MCCOY,"Yes. If we could put that out of operation, we might have a"
SPOCK,"Gentlemen, I'm constrained to point out we do not even know what"
KIRK,Those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the
SPOCK,Possible. I would have to have one to examine.
GUARD,"You'll have one, sir, if I have to rip one of the Kelvans apart"
KIRK,"You'll get your chance, but you'll do it under orders."
GUARD,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"On Eminiar Seven, you were able to trick the guard by a Vulcan"
SPOCK,"Yes, I recall, Captain. I led him to believe we had escaped."
KIRK,Do you think you can do it again?
SPOCK,I shall attempt it.
KIRK,Are you all right?
SPOCK,"Yes, I will be all right, Captain. We must hurry."
ROJAN, This cannot go unpunished. Hanar. That one.
THOMPSON,Captain?
ROJAN,"Go. As a leader, you realize the importance of discipline. I"
KIRK,I'm responsible. Let them go.
ROJAN,"I think we're somewhat alike, Captain. Each of us cares less for"
ROJAN,Bring them to me. This is the essence of what they were. The
MCCOY,"Spock, are you sure you're all right?"
SPOCK,"Yes, quite all right, Doctor."
MCCOY,You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch.
SPOCK,"I did not break it, Doctor. I was thrown away by something I've"
KIRK,What was it?
SPOCK,A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and
MCCOY,Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are?
SPOCK,Undoubtedly.
MCCOY,"Well, if they look that way normally, why did they adapt"
KIRK,Perhaps practicality. They chose the Enterprise as the best
MCCOY,"Well, that's enough. One wrong move, and they jam all our neural"
KIRK,"Jam. Spock, if you reverse the circuits on McCoy's"
SPOCK,"I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain. The"
KIRK,Is there a chance at all?
SPOCK,A small one.
KIRK,We'll take it. You and Bones have to get to the ship.
MCCOY,How?
KIRK,"Yes. Mister Spock, you're sick."
SPOCK,"I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health."
KIRK,"No, you're not. Doctor McCoy has given you an thorough"
MCCOY,"It's a good idea, Jim, but anyone looking at him can tell he's"
KIRK,"Vulcans have the ability to place themselves in a kind of trance,"
SPOCK,We find it more restful to the body than your so-called
KIRK,"Can you do it now and come out of it in the sickbay, say in half"
SPOCK,It will take me a moment to prepare.
KIRK,Go ahead.
MCCOY,"Jim, his heartbeat really is slow. His pulse is practically"
KIRK, Hanar? Hanar.
HANAR,"What do you want, human?"
KIRK,Mister Spock is ill. The doctor thinks he may be dying.
HANAR,This illness came on him rather suddenly. Is it not unusual?
KIRK,He's a Vulcan. They don't react like humans.
MCCOY,"He may die. If I can get him up to sickbay, there's a chance"
HANAR,Stand away from the door.  I
KIRK,"Do what you can with him, Bones."
CHAPEL,"Doctor, what happened?"
MCCOY,Prepare two ccs of stokaline.
CHAPEL,"Stokaline? But, doctor, that's"
MCCOY,"Don't argue, nurse. Just get it.  This may be the"
CHAPEL,"But, Doctor"
MCCOY,"Please, nurse, just follow orders, will you?"
MCCOY,"There, that should do it. Just let him rest now.  You"
TOMAR,Very well. I will inform Rojan. You will stay here.
KIRK,What do you want from me now?
ROJAN,We will beam aboard the vessel shortly. I wish you to understand
KIRK,My duty is to stop you in any way I can.
ROJAN,You will obey.
KIRK,Or you will kill more of my people?
ROJAN,"Captain Kirk, I cannot believe that you do not understand the"
KELINDA, These are lovely. Captain
KIRK,Flowers. I don't know the variety.
KELINDA,Our memory tapes tell us of such things on Kelvan. Crystals
KIRK,A rose by any other name.
KELINDA,Captain?
KIRK,"A quote from a great human poet, Shakespeare. That which we call"
ROJAN,Drea has computed and laid a course for
CHEKOV,We've jumped to warp eight.
ROJAN,And we'll go faster yet. Increase speed to warp eleven.
KIRK,"Increase speed to warp eleven, Mister Chekov."
DREA,On course and proceeding as planned. We will approach the barrier
ROJAN,Very well.
KIRK,"Rojan, I'm going to sickbay. My first officer was taken ill."
ROJAN,"Yes, I was informed. You may go."
KIRK,Anything?
SPOCK,"I've located their power source, captain. It's installed in"
MCCOY,We're just going to jam it.
SCOTT,I've tied in all the lab computers. That will give it a bit more
SCOTT,This is it. Now all we have to do
SPOCK,"Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible."
SCOTT,Why?
SPOCK,This material surrounding the projector is the same as I
SCOTT,"That's it, then."
SPOCK,"There is one other possibility, Mister Scott. The final"
SCOTT,I see what you're getting at. I can't say I like it.
SPOCK,Nor I. But it must be made available to the captain.
KIRK,Well?
SPOCK,"Impossible, Captain. The power source is protected by a material"
KIRK,What alternative?
SPOCK,The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy.
SCOTT,I have opened the control valves to the matter-anti-matter
KIRK,What?
SPOCK,"When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode. The Kelvans"
SCOTT,And so will we.
KIRK,Are you mad? I can't just
ROJAN,"Take your places, gentlemen. We're approaching the barrier."
KIRK,"Reading, Spock."
SPOCK,"Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy"
SCOTT,"Outside hull temperatures rising, sir. It's over two thousand"
KIRK,Hold your position.
CHEKOV,We made it.
SPOCK,"Instruments returning to normal, Captain."
UHURA,All decks report. Damage and casualties.
SCOTT,"Several systems out, sir. Operating on emergency backup. None"
SPOCK,Life support systems sustaining on emergency.
UHURA,"I'll have a full report on ship's status for you in a moment,"
ROJAN,"Your people are most efficient, Captain."
KIRK,Thank you. So are yours.
ROJAN,"Hanar, start the neutralising operation."
KIRK,What neutralising operation?
ROJAN,You humans are troublesome for us. We needed you to get us
KIRK,No!
ROJAN,"The procedure is already underway. Now, as to bridge personnel."
ROJAN,And since Drea is capable of handling the ship from here on.
ROJAN,Do you not agree that this is better thing for them than
KIRK,Is this all?
SPOCK,"I have reviewed ship's personnel, Captain. It appears we four"
MCCOY,Scotty tells me you could've destroyed the ship in the barrier.
KIRK,I couldn't.
MCCOY,But that was our only chance to stop them
KIRK,I didn't think it was.
MCCOY,Jim
KIRK,"Bones, that's enough!"
MCCOY,"Jim, I saw them reduce four of my doctors and nurses into those"
little KIRK,They've reduced the whole crew! 
TOMAR,I do not understand why you take the trouble to consume this
MCCOY,"Before you condemn it, why not try it?"
TOMAR,I believe I will. Assist me.
KIRK,"It's your idea, Doctor. Go ahead."
MCCOY,"All right, I'll show you how to work the selector."
SCOTT," Sir, why don't we try again to knock out the"
KIRK,"Even if we could, it's out of the question. We need that"
SCOTT,Then how will we stop the Kelvans?
SPOCK,Captain?
TOMAR,It's quite good.
MCCOY,I'm delighted.
SPOCK,Most curious.
KIRK,What is?
SPOCK,The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's
KIRK,But then Tomar shouldn't be enjoying the taste of his food.
SPOCK,"Yes. Quite correct, Captain. But they have taken human form and"
MCCOY,"If he keeps reacting like that, he's going to need a diet."
KIRK,"If they all respond to stimulation of the senses, then maybe we"
SPOCK,That seems reasonable.
KIRK,All right. It may be our only chance. Look for any way to
SCOTT,"I can think of one way right off.  Lad,"
MCCOY,I don't know about that.
HANAR,Please articulate.
MCCOY,"Well, that body of yours is a bit anaemic. Comes from taking"
HANAR,What are you doing?
MCCOY,I'm going to give you a shot. High-potency vitamin concentrate.
TOMAR,No more.
KIRK,Am I disturbing you?
KELINDA,What is it you wish?
KIRK,I wish to apologise.
KELINDA,"I don't understand, Captain."
KIRK,For hitting you. I'm sorry.
KELINDA,That is not necessary. You attempted to escape as we would
KIRK,"Yes, well, I don't usually go around beating up beautiful women."
KELINDA,Why not?
KIRK,"Well, there are better things for men and women to do."
KELINDA,Like what?
KIRK,Is this where I hit you?
KELINDA,"No, the other side."
KIRK,Oh. I'm sorry.  Is that better?
KELINDA,Better? Was it intended as a remedy?
KIRK,This is.
KELINDA,Is there some significance to this action?
KIRK,"Well, among humans, it's meant to express warmth and love."
KELINDA,Oh. You are trying to seduce me. I have been studying you.
KIRK,Me?
KELINDA,All humans. This business of love. You have devoted much
KIRK,We enjoy it.
KELINDA,The literature?
KIRK,"Kelinda, I'm sorry I brought up the whole subject."
KELINDA,Do you really regard this touching of the lips as pleasurable?
KIRK,I did.
KELINDA,Curious. Let me try.
ROJAN,"Is there some problem, Captain?"
KIRK,Not when I came in.
ROJAN,What did he want here?
KELINDA,He came to apologise for hitting me. Apparently it involves
ROJAN,"In what manner?  Very odd creatures, these"
TOMAR,Do you have more?
SCOTT,Not of this.
TOMAR,Anything.
SPOCK,"Yes. Humans are very peculiar. I often find them unfathomable,"
ROJAN,"Well, I do not understand this business of pressing with the"
SPOCK,I believe you're referring to a kiss. But it is my understanding
ROJAN,Kelinda has no affection for Captain Kirk.
SPOCK,Your game is off. Are you disturbed by the incident?
ROJAN,Why should I be disturbed?
SPOCK,You've known Kelinda for some time. She's a Kelvan as you are.
ROJAN,"I have no reason for such a reaction. Kelinda's a female,"
SPOCK,Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive.
ROJAN,"Well, of course she is!"
SPOCK,You are not jealous?
ROJAN,No!
SPOCK,Nor upset?
ROJAN,Certainly not.
SPOCK,Checkmate.
SCOTT,"I found this on Ganymood, er, Ganymede."
TOMAR,What is it?
SCOTT,"Well, it's, er.  It's green."

KELINDA,Have you given this order to the others?
ROJAN,No. And I wish you to particularly avoid Captain Kirk.

HANAR,How many more of these?
MCCOY,"Well, now, let's see. You've had three shots. I think you better"
HANAR,I see no reason for you to refer to yourself in the plural.
TOMAR,You have more?
SCOTT,"All I have is a bottle of very, very, very old Scotch. Whisky!"
TOMAR,I will try it.
SCOTT,"I'll get it! (takes the helmet off a breastplate and reaches in,"
I was saving you for TOMAR,What?
SCOTT,Never mind. Gie us your glass.
KIRK,"The thing is, I can't tell if we're getting"
MCCOY,We haven't seen Tomar either. But my man Hanar is getting more

SPOCK,"Doctor, I'm due for another injection of stokaline."
MCCOY,Hmm?
SPOCK,Stokaline.
MCCOY,Oh. You will pardon us.
KIRK,You had something to say?
KELINDA,Yes. This cultural mystique surrounding the biological
KIRK,Yes?
KELINDA,You realise humans are overly preoccupied with the subject.
KIRK,Yes. We do think a great deal about it.
KELINDA,"I've done some supplemental reading on it, and, er"
KIRK,You have a question?
KELINDA,"Yes. I was wondering, would you please apologise to me again?"
HANAR,"Rojan, I want to talk to you."
ROJAN,Very well.
HANAR,"First, I do not like the way responsibility and duty has been"
ROJAN,It's the way your duties have always been assigned.
HANAR,That is my second quarrel with you.
ROJAN,Hanar!
HANAR,"And further, I do not care much for the way you run this ship."
ROJAN,"Hanar, confine yourself to your quarters!"
KELINDA, Rojan has forbidden me to see you.
KIRK,"Yes, that's too bad. Why do you defy him?"
KELINDA,It's not a question of defiance. We were told to find out
KIRK,Huh. And how's the research going?
KELINDA,I need some more experiments.
ROJAN,"Mister Spock, you were not ordered to the"
SPOCK,Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require
ROJAN,Very well. Proceed. Have you seen Captain Kirk?
SPOCK,"If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge."
ROJAN,No. I was wondering where he was.
SPOCK,I left him in the recreation room.
ROJAN,He was alone then.
SPOCK,"No, Kelinda was with him. She seemed anxious to speak to him."
ROJAN,I told her to stay away from him.
SPOCK,"It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her. Or"
TOMAR,Very interesting. But I feel rather strange.
SCOTT,"We did it, you and me. Put him right under the table. (takes the"
ROJAN,"Kelinda, I told you to avoid this human."
KELINDA,I did not wish to.
ROJAN,I am your commander.
KIRK,"That's not enough, Rojan."
ROJAN,"You did this to her, corrupted her, turned her away from me!"
KIRK,"If you can't keep her, that's not my problem."
ROJAN,You will release her!
KIRK,Why don't you use your paralyser? You thought I was taking your

KIRK,I'm stimulating him.  You
ROJAN,You fool. These bodies are tools. We remain Kelvans!
KIRK,Look what's happened in the short time you've been exposed to us.
ROJAN,"We have a duty, our mission. We've got to accomplish any way we"
KIRK,Your mission is to find new worlds for your people to live in.
ROJAN,You would really do that? You would extend welcome to invaders?
KIRK,No. But we would welcome friends.
SPOCK,"Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given"
ROJAN,Perhaps. Perhaps it could be done.
SPOCK,A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation
ROJAN,"But if we retain this form, where could we find a place?"
MCCOY,Seems to me that little planet you were on is kind of nice.
ROJAN,And you. You would wish to remain with him?
KELINDA,"He's most interesting, but I wish to go with you. I believe I"
ROJAN,Yes. Very curious.
KIRK,"You see, Rojan, being human does have certain advantages. Being"
ROJAN,"Bridge, this is Rojan."

KIRK,"All right, Doctor, you built this thing. How"
DAYSTROM,This exercise is a trial for M-5. A shakedown. We must expect
KIRK,Correct it after you release control of my ship.
DAYSTROM,I can't.
SCOTT,"Captain, I suggest we disconnect it at the source."
DAYSTROM,Give me a few moments with it.
KIRK,"No! Stay here. All right, Scotty. Turn it off."
KIRK,That wasn't a minor difficulty. That wasn't a robot. That thing
DAYSTROM,It wasn't a deliberate act. M-5's analysis told it it needed
KIRK,And how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way?
SPOCK,"M-5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines,"
SCOTT,"So now it has virtually unlimited power. Captain, what'll we do?"
KIRK,"Spock, Scotty, come with me."
KIRK,"Report, Spock."
SPOCK,The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly
MCCOY,And communications and fire control.
KIRK,We'll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an
SPOCK,There is one possibility. The automatic helm navigation circuit
KIRK,Scotty?
SCOTT,Aye. I can take them out and cut in the manual override from
KIRK,How long?
SCOTT,"If Mister Spock helps me, maybe an hour."
KIRK,Make it less.
MCCOY,I'll get the man responsible in the first place. Where is
KIRK,"He's with the M-5 unit, watching it. I think it surprised even"
SPOCK,"Most illogical. Of all people, he should have known how the"
MCCOY,"Please, Spock, do me a favour and don't say it's fascinating."
SPOCK,No. But it is interesting.
SCOTT,"Aye, that's got it, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Good.
MCCOY,"Have you found a solution, a way to shut"
DAYSTROM,You don't shut a child off when it makes a mistake. M-5 is
MCCOY,Learning to kill.
DAYSTROM,To defend itself. It's quite a different thing. When a child
MCCOY,That thing is a danger to us all. Now find some way to shut it
DAYSTROM,You can't understand. You're frightened because you can't
MCCOY,The biographical tape of Richard Daystrom.
KIRK,Did you find anything?
MCCOY,"Not much, aside from the fact he's a genius."
KIRK,"Genius is an understatement. At the age of twenty four, he made"
MCCOY,"In his early twenties, Jim. That's over a quarter of a century"
KIRK,Isn't that enough for one lifetime?
MCCOY,Maybe that's the trouble. Where do you go from up? You publish
KIRK,"All right, it's difficult. What's your point?"
MCCOY,"The M-1 through M-4, remember? Not entirely successful. That's"
KIRK,"Genius doesn't work on an assembly line basis. Did Einstein,"
MCCOY,"Right. The government bought it, then Daystrom had to make it"
KIRK,"And he won't let Spock near it. What are you saying, that he's"
MCCOY,"Jim, if a man had a child who'd gone antisocial, killed perhaps,"
KIRK,Now he's got you talking about that machine like a personality.
MCCOY,I'm afraid that's the way he thinks about it.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,Good. Get Daystrom. We're on our way. Let's go.
DAYSTROM,"What is it, Captain?"
KIRK,"We're going to find out, Doctor. (At the foot of the Jefferies"
KIRK,Spock?
SPOCK,Mister Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter. As he does
KIRK,"Good, go ahead."
DAYSTROM,"No! No, no, no. You can't take control from the M-5."
KIRK,"Daystrom, we're going to do our best."
DAYSTROM,"You can't do it. Now let me work with it for a while, please."
KIRK,Spock.
SCOTT,"That's it, Mister Spock."
DAYSTROM,"Please, please!"
SPOCK,"Manual override is in control, Captain."
KIRK,"Bridge, this is Kirk. Sulu?"
KIRK,We've got helm and navigational control. Turn us about. Have
SULU,"Right away, sir. You heard him."
CHEKOV,I've been updating that course for hours.
KIRK,Kirk here.
SULU,"Captain, helm doesn't respond. Navigational"
SPOCK,Mister Chekov.
KIRK,Go to the engineering station.
CHEKOV,"Sir, G nine five system appears dead."
SPOCK,"Thank you, Ensign."
SPOCK,"It appears, Captain, we've been doing"
SCOTT,But it was active. I'd stake all that I know that it was.
SPOCK,"I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted"
MCCOY,Decoyed. It wanted us to waste our time.
KIRK,While it was getting ready for what? Spock?
SPOCK,I do not know. It is not performing in a logical manner.
KIRK,"Doctor Daystrom. Doctor Daystrom, I want an answer right now. I'm"
SPOCK,"I do not mean to offend, sir, but it behaves with an almost"
KIRK,"Well, Doctor?"
DAYSTROM,"Yes, quite right, Mister Spock. You see, one of the arguments"
KIRK,Your new approach?
DAYSTROM,Exactly. I've developed a method of impressing human engrams
KIRK,Kirk here. What is it?
UHURA,"Sir, sensors are picking up four Federation"
KIRK,The main attack force. The war games.
MCCOY,But M-5 doesn't know it's a game.
KIRK,"Correction, Bones. Those four ships don't know it's M-5's game."
UHURA,"Enterprise to USS Lexington. Come in, Lexington. Sir, I can't"
KIRK,Put it on.
UHURA,"Captain, M-5 is acknowledging."
KIRK,"Daystrom, does M-5 understand that this is only a drill?"
DAYSTROM,"Of course. It was programmed to understand, Captain. The ore"
t know CHEKOV,"Sir, deflector shield just came on. Speed increasing to warp"
SULU,"Phasers locking on lead ship, sir. Power levels at full strength."
KIRK,Full strength?
MCCOY,"If that thing cuts loose against unshielded ships, we're in"
KIRK,That's no miscalculation.
SPOCK,"Attack force closing rapidly, breaking formation, attacking at"
SULU,"Our phasers are firing, sir."
SPOCK,Hit on the Lexington.
WESLEY,Full phasers. What the devil is Kirk doing?
CHEKOV,"Turning now, sir."
KIRK,"Estimate damage on Lexington, Spock."
SPOCK,Hit in engineering section. Possible damage to her impulse
SULU,"We're firing again, sir."
SPOCK,"The Excalibur, a direct hit."
CHEKOV,"Closing on the Lexington again, sir. The Hood and Potemkin are"
SULU,"Phasers firing, Captain."
SPOCK,Lexington hit again.
KIRK,There's got to be a way of getting to the M-5. There's got to be
DAYSTROM,There isn't. It's fully protected itself.
SPOCK,"Probably true, Captain. It works faster, thinks faster than we"
UHURA,"Captain, visual contact with Lexington."
KIRK,Lieutenant?
UHURA,I'm sorry. I can't override M-5 interference.
KIRK,There's your murder charge. Deliberate. Calculated. It's killing
DAYSTROM,It misunderstood.
CHEKOV,"Excalibur is maneuvering away, sir. We're increasing speed to"
SULU,Phasers locked on.
KIRK,Daystrom!
SULU,Phasers firing.
DAYSTROM,I really don't know how to get to the M-5. I really do not
SPOCK,"Doctor Daystrom, you impressed human engrams on the M-5"
CHEKOV,"Coming to new course, sir. Bearing on the Potemkin."
SULU,Phasers firing. A hit.
KIRK,Whose engrams?
DAYSTROM,"Why, mine, of course."
MCCOY,Of course.
SPOCK,Then perhaps you could talk to the unit. M-5 has no reason to
KIRK,The computer tie-in. You spoke to it before. It knows you.
UHURA,"Captain, I'm getting the Lexington again. Tapping in on their"
DAYSTROM,They can't do that. They'll destroy the M-5.
KIRK,You can save the M-5 if you talk to it and make it stop the
DAYSTROM,I can make it stop. I created it. 
DAYSTROM,"This is,  this is Daystrom."
DAYSTROM,"M-5, do you know me?"
Born DAYSTROM,"Stop. M-5, your attack on the starships is wrong. You must"
MCCOY,"I don't like the sound of him, Jim."
KIRK,You'd better pray that the M-5 listens to the sound of him.
DAYSTROM,But these are not enemy vessels. These are Federation
DAYSTROM,"Survive, yes. Protect yourself, but not murder. You must not"
KIRK, Spock. The M-5 is not responding to him like a
SPOCK,"I am most impressed with the technology, Captain. Doctor"
DAYSTROM,We will survive. Nothing can hurt you. I gave you that. You
MCCOY,"Jim, he's on the edge of a nervous breakdown, if not insanity."
KIRK,The M-5 must be destroyed.
DAYSTROM,"Destroyed, Kirk? No. We're invincible. Look what we've done."
KIRK,"Security, take him to Sickbay."
SPOCK,Fascinating.
KIRK,"Take care of him, Doctor."
KIRK,Battle status?
SULU,The other three ships are holding station out of range. The
UHURA,"Captain, Lexington is receiving a message from Starfleet. They"
KIRK,Go on.
KIRK,They've just signed their own death warrant. M-5 will kill them
SPOCK,"Every living thing wants to survive, Captain. Daystrom must have"
KIRK,Suppose it's still open to impression. Suppose it absorbed the
CHEKOV,"Captain, the ships are coming within range again."
SPOCK,Commodore Wesley is a dedicated commander. I should regret
KIRK,The instrument of his death will not be the Enterprise if I can
KIRK,This is Captain Kirk. You will be under attack in a moment.
KIRK,You have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly
KIRK,Why?
SPOCK,"Captain, attack force almost within phaser range."
KIRK,There were many men aboard those ships. They were murdered. Must
KIRK,Why?
KIRK,"But you have murdered. Scan the starship Excalibur, which you"
KIRK,Because you murdered it. What is the penalty for murder?
KIRK,And how will you pay for your acts of murder?
KIRK,M-5?
CHEKOV,"Sir, deflector shields have dropped."
SULU,"All phaser power gone, sir."
SPOCK,M-5 is leaving itself open to attack. The machine is committing
KIRK,"Scotty, Spock, before it changes its mind. Get down to"
KIRK,Lieutenant.
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,Intership communications. This is the captain speaking. In
WESLEY,Phasers on target.
KIRK,Kirk here.
SPOCK,"The force field is gone, Captain. M-5 is"
SCOTT,"System's coming back. I can give you power for the shields, sir."
KIRK,I need communications.
SCOTT,That'll take longer.
SCOTT,Sir!
KIRK,Cut power. Keep those shields down.
WESLEY,The Enterprise looks dead. I'm going to
UHURA,Captain.
MCCOY,He'll have to be committed to a total
SPOCK,I would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same
KIRK,That's exactly the situation I was hoping for when I forced the
KIRK,Daystrom felt such an act was against the laws of God and man.
SPOCK,"Captain, why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire"
KIRK,I wasn't sure. Any other commander would have simply followed
KIRK,I gambled on his humanity.
KIRK,Bridge. His logical selection was compassion.
MCCOY,Compassion. That's the one thing no machine ever had. Maybe it's
SPOCK,"No, Doctor. I simply maintain that computers are more efficient"
MCCOY,"But tell me, which do you prefer to have around?"
SPOCK,I presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between
MCCOY,"I was just trying to make conversation, Spock."
SPOCK,It would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on a
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, take us back to the space"
Original Airdate,"15 Mar, 1968"
SPOCK,"No doubt about it, Captain. The space debris comes from the"
KIRK,"Missing for six years, and now this junk in space."
SPOCK,"Portions of the antimatter nacelles, personal belongings."
KIRK,"Then whatever destroyed the ship, the crew was able to get off"
CHEKOV,"Computed and on the board, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, assuming that the wreckage drifted at the same"
SPOCK,"It would have come from planet four, star system eight nine two,"
CHEKOV,"Only one sixteenth parsec away, Captain. We should be there in"
KIRK,Standard orbit around the planet. There may be survivors there.
SPOCK,SS Beagle. Small class four stardrive vessel. Crew of forty
KIRK,"Yes, at the academy. He was dropped in his fifth year. He went"
CHEKOV,"Coming up on the planet, captain."
KIRK,Put it on the screen.
CHEKOV,"Definitely class M, somewhat similar to Earth."
KIRK,"Yes, similar. But the land masses and oceans are quite different,"
SPOCK,"Different in shape only, Captain. The proportion of land to"
KIRK,"Exactly in some ways, different in others."
SPOCK,I also picked up indications of large cities.
KIRK,What era?
SPOCK,"No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio"
UHURA,"Captain, both amplitude and frequency modulation being used. I"
SPOCK,Television was the colloquial term.
KIRK,Put it on the screen.
UHURA,Aye.
UHURA,"Transmission lost, sir. Shall I try to get it back?"
KIRK,"Slaves and gladiators. What are we seeing, a twentieth-century"
SPOCK,"Captain, the one described as the barbarian is also listed here."
KIRK,"Ready the transporter room, Mister Spock. We're beaming down."
KIRK,"You could have selected a more convenient place, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"But hardly more practical, captain. Close to the city we"
SPOCK,Fascinating. This atmosphere is remarkably similar to your
MCCOY,The word was smog.
SPOCK,"Yes, I believe that was the term. I had no idea you were that"
MCCOY,"I am not, Mister Spock. I was simply trying to stop you from"
KIRK,The SS Beagle was the first ship to make a survey of this star
SPOCK,"Then the Prime Directive is in full force, Captain?"
KIRK,No identification of self or mission. No interference with the
MCCOY,"No references to space, or the fact that there are other worlds,"
KIRK,Let's go.
MCCOY,"One, just once, I'd like to be able to land someplace and say,"
SPOCK,"I fail to see the humour in that situation, Doctor."
MCCOY,Naturally. You could hardly claim to be an angel with those
SPOCK,Complete Earth parallel. The language here is English.
KIRK,"I think he means it, Spock."
SPOCK,There would seem to be evidence to that effect.
FLAVIUS,Who are you?
KIRK,We come from another province.
FLAVIUS, Where are you from? What do you call those?
SPOCK,I call them ears.
FLAVIUS,Are you trying to be funny?
SPOCK,Never. Colloquial twentieth-century English. An amazing
KIRK,We come from a place that's quite some journey from here. I doubt
ve heard FLAVIUS,Uniforms. Probably some new Praetorian guard unit. I should
FLAVIUS,"I didn't harm them, Septimus, as much as I"
SEPTIMUS, Keep always in
MCCOY,"For which we are grateful, for we are men of peace ourselves."
SEPTIMUS,Oh? Are you Children of the Sun?
MCCOY,"Well, if you're speaking of worships of sorts, we represent many"
FLAVIUS,"There is only one true belief! Roman butchers, sent here by"
KIRK,Do we look like any Romans you ever saw ?
SEPTIMUS,Then are you slaves like ourselves?
KIRK,Our people don't believe in slavery.
FLAVIUS,A Roman lie. We must kill them.
SPOCK,"Sir, we came here looking for some friends, forty seven of them"
FLAVIUS,"Septimus, I know killing is evil, but sometimes it's"
SEPTIMUS,No.
FLAVIUS,"But they've located us, our hiding place. It's better to kill"
KIRK,Wait. I can prove we're telling the truth. A small device. I'll
KIRK,"Scotty, lock in on my transmission beam. Scan us."
KIRK,"Including ourselves, how many of us are there?"
KIRK,"Good, Scotty. Continue scanning. We'll maintain transmission."
SEPTIMUS,"Tell me the empire has a device like that, Flavius, and you"
SEPTIMUS,"No, Captain. I'm sure I would have heard of the arrival of"
KIRK,"Perhaps you've heard, let's say, an impossible story or a rumour"
SEPTIMUS,There are no other worlds.
KIRK,The stars.
SEPTIMUS,Lights shining through from heaven. It is where the sun is.
KIRK,"Yes, of course."
SPOCK," Captain, I thought you might find this"
KIRK,Spock?
SPOCK,Fascinating.
KIRK, The Jupiter Eight. Conventional
SEPTIMUS,"Taken from the names of false gods. When I was a senator, I"
KIRK,"Septimus, we need your help. We must go into the city. We know"
SEPTIMUS,My advice to you is to leave. Go back where you came from.
KIRK,We can't do that. Perhaps you know his name. Merik. Captain
SEPTIMUS,Merikus?
KIRK,Yes. He's the leader of our friends.
SEPTIMUS,Merikus is first citizen. Butcher.
KIRK,That doesn't sound like the same man.
SPOCK,"Captain, a logical question, if I may. Septimus, how many years"
SEPTIMUS,Perhaps five years.
FLAVIUS,Almost six. I was there when he became lord of the games. If
KIRK,"Septimus, wherever we may be from, you must believe that it is"
SEPTIMUS,First I must discuss it with the others.
SPOCK,"Curious, Captain, the similarity in names. Were you told why"
KIRK,He failed a psycho-simulator test. All it takes is a split second
MCCOY,Odd that these people should worship the sun.
SPOCK,"Why, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"Because, my dear Mister Spock, it is illogical. Rome had no sun"
SEPTIMUS,We have decided. Flavius will guide you. We will provide you
FLAVIUS,We'll wait here until dark.
KIRK,"Are you a slave, Flavius?"
FLAVIUS,You are barbarians indeed not to know of Flavius Maximus. For
KIRK,Then you heard the word of the sun?
FLAVIUS,Yes. The words of peace and freedom. It wasn't easy for me to
KIRK,There are many things I'd like to know
MAXIMUS,Hold! Don't move! Hands in the air!
MAXIMUS,"You have been too long absent from the games, Flavius. The"
KIRK,Tell Merikus I'd like to see him.
MAXIMUS,The first citizen? Why would he bother with arena bait like
KIRK,Tell him it's Jim Kirk. Perhaps a friend.
MAXIMUS,Perhaps?
KIRK,"Well, if I am a friend and you don't tell him, do you really want"
KIRK,"But if there have been slaves for over 2,000 years, hasn't there"
FLAVIUS,"Long ago there were rebellions, but they were suppressed. And"
SPOCK,Even more fascinating. Slavery evolving into an institution with
MCCOY,"Quite logical, I'd say, Mister Spock. Just as it's logical that"
SPOCK,"Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation"
MCCOY,"What term? Logic? Medical men are trained in logic, Mister"
SPOCK,"Really, Doctor, I had no idea they were trained. Watching you, I"
FLAVIUS,"Are they enemies, Captain?"
KIRK,I'm not sure they're sure. When the slaves began to worship the
FLAVIUS,Long ago. Perhaps as long ago as the beginning of the empire.
KIRK,"You go on believing it, Flavius. All men are brothers."
MAXIMUS,Flavius. Your friends are waiting for you. You've already been
FLAVIUS,I will not fight. I'm a Brother of the Sun.
MAXIMUS,"Put a sword in your hand, and you'll fight. I know you,"
MAXIMUS,You three come with us.
KIRK,Three against three. We may never get a better chance.
MAXIMUS,No talking. Outside.
KIRK, I doubt if he'll get very far. He feels ill.
MCCOY,I do?
MAXIMUS,Outside!
KIRK,"All right, but he'll double over before we get very far. (Spock"
MCCOY,"No, I think I can walk. I'll try."
KIRK,Let's go.
MERIK," Well done, Jim. "
CLAUDIUS,But it was exciting. They'd do well in the arena.
KIRK,"Captain Merik, isn't it ?"
MERIK,"Yes, it's me. This is our Proconsul, Claudius Marcus."
CLAUDIUS,But this is no place for a reunion.
MERIK,"This way. Your friends, too. There's lots to talk about, lots to"
KIRK,I agree.
MERIK,"Don't judge me before you know the facts. Come on, we can talk"
MERIK,You can leave us.
MERIK,"Well, a celebration. A meeting of old friends."
CLAUDIUS,Prepare food for our friends. They've come from a great
MERIK,This other is your ship's surgeon?
KIRK,McCoy.
MERIK,It's a pity we can't let him loose in our hospitals. Our level
CLAUDIUS,Come. You must be hungry. Gentlemen?
CLAUDIUS,"Oh, try the sparrow broiled in garum. Delicious. Or perhaps"
KIRK,"All right, what happened?"
MERIK,"We had meteor damage, Jim. I went ashore with a landing party to"
KIRK,Go on.
MERIK,He convinced me it would be unfair to this world to carry word
CLAUDIUS,"Contamination. Can't risk that. Oh, you'll understand as you"
MERIK,So I made the decision to stay.
KIRK,"What happened to your crew? Did they voluntarily beam, come"
MERIK,"This is an ordered world, Jim, a conservative world based on"
KIRK,What happened to your crew?
MERIK,"There's been no war here for over four hundred years, Jim."
SPOCK,"Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite"
MCCOY,Are you out of your head?
SPOCK,"I said I understood it, Doctor. I find the checks and balances"
MCCOY,Next he'll be telling us he prefers it over Earth history.
SPOCK,They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three
MCCOY,"They have slavery, gladiatorial games, despotism."
SPOCK,Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your
CLAUDIUS,"Interesting. And you, Captain, which world do you prefer?"
KIRK,"My world, proconsul, is my vessel, my oath, my crew. What"
MERIK,"And as for my men, those that were able to adapt to this world"
KIRK,You sent your own men into the arena?
MERIK,"Just as I did, Jim, you're going to order your own people"
MCCOY,You must know that's impossible. Starfleet regulations
CLAUDIUS,Are designed to circumvent any such order. There may be over
MERIK,"They're going to be arriving soon, anyway, Jim. A recon party,"
KIRK,Do you really believe I could be made to order my own people
CLAUDIUS,"I believe this, Captain. That you would do almost anything"
MCCOY,Jim.
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"Scotty, if you have a fix.  Stand"
CLAUDIUS,"Very wise of you, Captain. No point in sending up"
KIRK,"Yet on the other hand, my chief engineer's standing by for a"
CLAUDIUS,"I do hope so, for your sake. Now, Captain, what are you going"
KIRK,If I brought down a hundred of them armed with phasers
CLAUDIUS,you could probably defeat the combined armies of our entire
SPOCK,Quite correct.
MCCOY,Must you always be so blasted honest?
CLAUDIUS,"But on the other hand, why even bother to send your men down?"
MERIK,"Jim, you've already started a message. Your engineer's waiting."
KIRK,Scotty. Sorry to keep you waiting.
CLAUDIUS,Order your officers to come down.
KIRK,"Condition Green, all's well. Kirk out."
CLAUDIUS,"Guards, take them. Prepare them for the games."
MERIK,"Ah, that was stupid, Jim. This is not an Academy training test."
SCOTT,But they have used the code term Condition
CHEKOV,That may take some time.
SCOTT,"Let it take time, lad. They're in trouble, and I'm under orders"
ANNOUNCER,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Live and direct from"
ANNOUNCER,"Stand by. Ten seconds. And first tonight, ladies and"
FLAVIUS,"I don't mind fighting, but why you?"
ANNOUNCER,"Flavius may be getting off to a slow start, but he's never"
SPOCK,I tell you I'm well able to defeat you.
ACHILLES,"Fight, barbarian!"
MERIK,Most of my men went the same way. I hoped I would feel it less
SPOCK,I do not want to injure you.
MASTER,"Fight, you two. You bring this network's ratings down, Flavius,"
CLAUDIUS,"Question, Captain?"
KIRK,"The rules. If Spock should finish his man off first, would he be"
able to help CLAUDIUS,We believe men should fight their own battles. Only the weak
MERIK,Maybe now you understand why I gave in. The Romans have always
CLAUDIUS,"Quite true, Captain Kirk. The games have always strengthened"
FLAVIUS,At least defend yourself.
MCCOY,I am defending myself!
FLAVIUS,"Not like that, you fool. Hold your weapon higher."
CLAUDIUS,"Admit it. You find these games frightening, revolting."
KIRK,"Proconsul, in some parts of the galaxy I have seen forms of"
CLAUDIUS,"Certain this isn't different, Captain? Those are your men"
KIRK,I've had to select men to die before so that others could be
CLAUDIUS,"You're a clever liar, Captain Kirk. Merikus was a spaceship"
MERIK,"He commands not just a spaceship, Proconsul, but a starship. A"
CLAUDIUS,I see no evidence of superiority. They fight no better than
ACHILLES,Stop running. Fight.
SPOCK,"Need any help, Doctor?"
MCCOY,Whatever gave you that idea?
ACHILLES,"Fight, you pointed-ear freak!"
MCCOY,"You tell him, buster. Of all the completely ridiculous,"
MASTER,"A clear foul, Proconsul. Your decision?"
CLAUDIUS,"Your opinion, Merikus? After all, they're like yourself."
MERIK,"It's your decision, Proconsul."
CLAUDIUS,"Your opinion, Captain Kirk? Would you like me to kill them"
DRUSILLA,"I was told to wait for you and provide wine, food, whatever"
KIRK,It won't work.
DRUSILLA,What will not work?
KIRK,"Whatever he has in mind, whatever tricks. You hear that,"
DRUSILLA,We're alone. Please believe me. I've never lied to one who
MCCOY,"Angry, Mister Spock, or frustrated, perhaps?"
SPOCK,"Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor. I'm merely testing the"
MCCOY,"For the fifteenth time. Spock. Spock, I know we've had our"
m trying to say is SPOCK,"Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be"
MCCOY,"Well, what I'm trying to say is you saved my life in the arena."
SPOCK,"Yes, that's quite true."
MCCOY,"I'm trying to thank you, you pointed-eared hobgoblin!"
SPOCK,"Oh, yes. You humans have that emotional need to express"
would mean areduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore MCCOY,"Do you know why you're not afraid to die, Spock? You're more"
SPOCK,"Really, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"I know. I'm worried about Jim, too."
KIRK,Very good.  Excellent.
DRUSILLA,I was concerned. I am ordered to please you.
KIRK,I've been in some strange worlds with strange customs. Perhaps
DRUSILLA,Torture? I do not understand. I do not wish to see you
KIRK,You'll be the first to know.
CLAUDIUS,Captain.  I'm sorry I was detained.
CLAUDIUS,See if he has it. Not that I would have punished her. I would
MERIK,"No, Proconsul."
CLAUDIUS,I am sorry I was detained. I trust there was nothing further
KIRK,Nothing except perhaps an explanation.
CLAUDIUS,"Because you're a man, I owe you that. You must die shortly,"
CLAUDIUS,"Because you are a man, I gave you some last hours as a man."
KIRK,I appreciate that.
CLAUDIUS,"Unfortunately, we must demonstrate that defiance is"
KIRK,Of course.
CLAUDIUS,"But I've learned to respect you. I promise you, you will die"
KIRK,I thank you. And my friends?
CLAUDIUS,"When their time comes, the same of course. Guards. Take him"
KIRK,I've heard it was similar.
ANNOUNCER,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
CLAUDIUS,"Make it a quick, single thrust."
MASTER,Don't move. You'll only die harder.
FLAVIUS," Murderers! If you want death, fight"
SCOTT,"Now, Mister Chekov. Activate."
CLAUDIUS,"Guards, don't let him escape! Guards!"
MCCOY,Jim!
KIRK,Stand back.
KIRK,"Obsolete, but effective."
MCCOY,"What happened, Jim?"
SPOCK,What did they do to you?
KIRK,They threw me a few curves. No time to explain.
CLAUDIUS,"Hold! We're in each other's line of fire. I pity you, Captain"
MERIK," Starship, lock in on this. Three to beam"
KIRK,"And strong personal feelings, he obeyed the"
SCOTT,"Thank you, Captain."
KIRK,Gentlemen.
MCCOY,"Captain, I see on your report Flavius was killed. I am sorry. I"
SPOCK,I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely.
UHURA,"I'm afraid you have it all wrong, Mister Spock, all of you. I've"

UHURA,Order?
SCOTT,From Starfleet. The order to enter the Neutral Zone.
UHURA,"There's been no order I know of, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,Surely the Captain couldn't be doing this on his own authority.

KIRK,You're grossly mistaken if you think we were there

SPOCK,The question is irrelevant.
COMMANDER,"Possibly, but you are subordinate to Captain Kirk's orders,"
SPOCK,My duty as an officer is to obey him.
COMMANDER,You are a superior being. Why do you not command?
SPOCK,I do not desire a ship of my own.
COMMANDER,"Or is it that no one has offered you, a Vulcan, that"
SPOCK,Such opportunities are extremely rare.
COMMANDER,"For someone with your capabilities and accomplishments,"
SPOCK,That thought has occasionally crossed my mind.

SPOCK,"There is no alternative, Doctor. The safety of the crew is now"

KIRK,Oh.  My neck feels like it's been twisted off.
MCCOY,That's the Vulcan death grip for you.
CHAPEL,There's no such thing as a Vulcan death grip.
KIRK,"Ah, but the Romulans don't know that. Sure fooled the doctors."
MCCOY,You took a big chance they didn't start an autopsy.

KIRK,"Analysis, Spock."
SPOCK,An alien metal of some kind. An alloy resistant to probe.
KIRK,Any theories about what it is?
SPOCK,"Negative, Captain. Structures of this complexity require"
MCCOY,"Meadows and no meteor craters. The whole place is an enigma,"
KIRK,"What's the nearest concentration of life forms, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,Bearing one one seven mark four.
KIRK,And how much time did you say we have to investigate?
SPOCK,If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course
KIRK,You did say thirty minutes?
SPOCK,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,Then let's go. Let's find out what life forms are blessed by this
MCCOY,"Why, they look like. I'd swear they're American Indians."
SPOCK,"They are, Doctor. A mixture of Navajo, Mohican, and Delaware, I"
KIRK,"It's like discovering Atlantis or Shangri-la. Mister Spock, is it"
SPOCK,"Highly improbable, Captain. Sensor probes indicate only one type"
MCCOY,"Shouldn't we contact them, Jim? Tell them?"
KIRK,Tell them what? That an asteroid's coming to smash their world
SPOCK,"Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, Doctor. Our"
KIRK,We've got a job to do. Let's get back to the Enterprise.
MCCOY,"What's the matter, Jim?"
KIRK,"What? Oh, nothing. It's just so peaceful, uncomplicated. No"
MCCOY,Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting. Back in
KIRK,"Ah, the Tahiti Syndrome. Let's go take care of that asteroid. But"
SPOCK,Doctor?
MCCOY,Yes.
SPOCK,I suggest that any further research on your part be delayed
KIRK, Kirk to Enterprise. (and drops
SPOCK,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,"Prepare to beam us up, Mister Scott. We're warping out of orbit."
MCCOY,"Leaving? You can't be serious, Spock."
SPOCK,"Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon."
theangle becomes so great that even the power of a starship MCCOY,"The devil with an asteroid! It won't get here for two months,"
SPOCK,"If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get"
MCCOY,"In the meantime, what about Jim?"
SPOCK,"Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and"
MCCOY,That may be hours from now. He may be injured or dying.
SPOCK," Doctor, assume"
MCCOY,"Can a few more minutes matter, Spock?"
SPOCK,"In the time it's taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid"
MIRAMANEE,Wait.
KIRK,Who are you?
MIRAMANEE,We are your people. We've been waiting for you to come to
SCOTT,"I can't give you warp nine much longer,"
SPOCK,"Stress or not, we cannot reduce speed. I do"
SCOTT,"All right, but we're moving further into the danger range all"

ELDER,Miramanee has said that you appeared to her
KIRK,"I'll answer anything I can, but as I told you, many things are"
SALISH,He knows nothing of our danger. How could he save us?
ELDER,"It is against custom to interrupt a tribal elder at council,"
SALISH,"Elder, words will not save us when the skies darken. We must be"
ELDER,Our skies have darkened three times since the harvest. The last
KIRK,"I came from the temple, as Miramanee said, and it was a beginning"
MIRAMANEE,"Salish, a terrible thing has happened. The boy was attending"
SALISH,There is no sound in the body. There is no light in the eyes.
KIRK,Wait a moment.
ELDER,Wait.
KIRK,He'll be all right now.
ELDER,My people are grateful.
KIRK,It's a simple technique. It goes way back. Way back.
ELDER,Only a god can breathe life into the dead. Do you still
CHEKOV,Deflection point minus seven.
SCOTT,"The relays will reject the overload, Mister Spock!"
SPOCK,Then bypass the relays and go to manual control.
SPOCK,"I want full power, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,"All right, you lovelies. Hold together. Full"
SPOCK,"Magnification factor twelve, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,Deflection point minus four.
SPOCK,All engines stop. Hold position here.
SPOCK,Prepare to activate deflectors.
SULU,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,"Power dropping, sir."
SPOCK,"Engineering, maintain full power. Full power."
SPOCK,Not now.
CHEKOV,"Zero. Deflection point now, sir."
SPOCK,Activate deflectors.
CHEKOV,"Power dropping, sir."
SPOCK,"Degree of deflection, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Not enough, Mister Spock. It's only point zero zero one three"
SPOCK,Recircuit power to engines. Maximum speed heading three seven
SULU,"Aye, sir."
CHEKOV,"That heading will put us directly in the asteroid's path, sir."
SPOCK,"Correct, Mister Chekov. I intend to retreat in front of that"
MCCOY,What for?
SPOCK,To destroy it. A narrow beam concentrated on a single spot will

SPOCK,Incorrect. We'll still be able to get out of its path by use of
MCCOY,Jim won't be able to get out of its path.
SPOCK,"That, Doctor, is another calculated risk we must take."
SALISH,Miramanee. What are you doing?
MIRAMANEE,"I must see to the needs of the god, as is my duty."
SALISH,You should be working on our ritual cloak.
MIRAMANEE,"There will be no ritual between us now, Salish."
SALISH,What do you mean? We cannot go against tradition.
MIRAMANEE,It is because of tradition that I cannot marry you.
SALISH,But you are promised to me.
MIRAMANEE,That was before he came.
SALISH,Tribal priestess and medicine chief are always joined.
MIRAMANEE,"He is medicine chief now. Salish, choose another. Any maiden"
SALISH,I wish no other.
MIRAMANEE,You have no choice.
SALISH,"Miramanee, if you could choose, would you choose me?"
MIRAMANEE,Perhaps you would like to bathe now.
KIRK,"Miramanee, tell me about the Wise Ones."
MIRAMANEE,Tell? But a god knows everything.
KIRK,Not this one. Tell me.
MIRAMANEE,The Wise Ones brought us here from far away. They chose a
KIRK,Secrets of the temple.
MIRAMANEE,There are no lacings.  How is this thing
KIRK,The secrets were passed on from father to son?
MIRAMANEE,Yes. How does this open?
KIRK,"Well, why doesn't Salish use it? Why are the people in danger?"
MIRAMANEE,His father did not wish to share his power too soon. He died
ELDER,"Our people rejoice and wish to honour your name, but I did not"
KIRK,"Ki, Kir"
ELDER,Kirok?
ELDER,Have we displeased you?
KIRK,"No, no, everything is fine."
ELDER,"Then it must be ourselves, the way we live. Perhaps we have not"
KIRK,"Your land is rich, your people happy. Who could be displeased"
ELDER,But there is something. Tell us. We will change it.
KIRK,I can't tell you anything. All I can tell you is that I'm happy
KIRK,Why are they so sure I can help them?
MIRAMANEE,"Well, you came from the stone metal. Did you not bring life"
KIRK,"Yes, but I. I need time to remember."
MIRAMANEE,Here there is much time. For everything.
SPOCK,"Co-ordinates, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,Tau eight point seven. Beta point zero four one.
SPOCK,That is our target. The asteroid's weakest point.
CHEKOV,"Almost dead centre, sir."
SPOCK,"Lock all phasers on that mark. Maximum intensity, narrow beam. I"
MCCOY,You sound like you're cutting a diamond.
SPOCK,"Very astute, Doctor."
SULU,"All phasers locked, sir."
SPOCK,We'll fire in sequence and continue firing as long as Mister

SPOCK,Fire phasers.
SULU,Phaser one firing.

KIRK,The Joining day?
MIRAMANEE,I'm the daughter of the chief. Tribal law betroths me to our

MIRAMANEE,God's wish is above tribal law.
KIRK,Name the Joining day.
MIRAMANEE,"The sooner our happiness together begins, the longer it will"
SPOCK,Estimated repair time?
SCOTT,Hanging here in space? Forever.
SPOCK,"I've already surmised that. Thank you, Mister Scott."
MCCOY,"Well, Spock, you took your calculated risk in your calculated"
SPOCK,"I accept the responsibility, Doctor."
MCCOY,And my responsibility is the health of this crew. You've been

MCCOY,"Back to that planet? Without warp speed, it'll take months,"
SPOCK,"Exactly fifty nine point two two three days, Doctor, and that"
MCCOY,Well then what's the use? We might not be able to save the
SPOCK,"Another calculated Vulcan risk, Doctor."
WOMAN,This joining means the end of darkness.
MIRAMANEE,It's a time for joy for all my people.
ELDER,You will wait until I walk the holy path to the earth lodge
KIRK,"Get out of my way, Salish."
SALISH,"Even though you be a god, Kirok, I cannot permit this Joining."
KIRK,Nobody's asking for your permission.
SALISH,Then you must strike me dead.
KIRK,I have no intention of striking you dead.
SALISH,"You bleed. You bleed, Kirok. Behold a god who bleeds! Behold a"
SALISH,"Kill me. Kill me, Kirok, for I will not rest until I prove to"
MCCOY,I thought you were reporting to Sickbay.
SPOCK,"There isn't time, Doctor. I must decipher those obelisk's"
MCCOY,You've been trying to do that ever since we started back to that
SPOCK,"I'm aware of that, Doctor. I'm also aware when we arrive at the"
MCCOY,"Well, you won't read them by killing yourself. You've hardly"
SPOCK,"I am not hungry, Doctor. And under stress, we Vulcans can do"
MCCOY,"Well, your Vulcan metabolism is so low it can hardly be"

MCCOY,"Well, my diagnosis is exhaustion brought on from overwork and"
KIRK,Miramanee. Come here. Miramanee.
MIRAMANEE,Each time your arms hold me is as joyous as the first.
KIRK,"I'm happy. I'm so happy. If it weren't for the dreams, my mind"
MIRAMANEE,"I thought you no longer had the dreams, that you no longer"
KIRK,"They've come back. They were gone for a while, but they've come"
MIRAMANEE,I have a gift for you.
KIRK,A gift? What?
MIRAMANEE,It may make you happy. Wait.
MIRAMANEE,I bear your child.
KIRK,You!
KIRK,A canal. And with it we'll bring the water from the lake right to
MIRAMANEE,And with the power of the lamp. Lamp?
KIRK,Lamp.
MIRAMANEE,"Which turns night into day, we can cook twice as much food,"
pre KIRK,Preserve.
MIRAMANEE,Preserve.
KIRK,Preserve.
KIRK,"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. That's not why I made the lamp at"
KIRK,It's only the wind and the thunder.
MIRAMANEE,I act like a stupid child. I have nothing to fear. You are
MIRAMANEE,To go to the temple. The people will be waiting.
KIRK,Why?
MIRAMANEE,To save them.
KIRK,But it's only the wind. The wind can't harm them.
MIRAMANEE,"The wind is only the beginning. Soon the sky will darken,"
KIRK,But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky.
MIRAMANEE,"If we don't go now, it will be too late. You must go inside"
KIRK,I don't know how to get inside the temple.
MIRAMANEE,But you are a god.
ELDER, Kirok! Kirok!
SALISH,"Why are you not at the temple, Kirok? Soon the ground will"
KIRK,We'll go to the caves. It'll be safe there.
SALISH,The caves? Surely a legend can do more than that for his
ELDER,"When the ground trembles the caves are not safe, Kirok. If you"
MIRAMANEE,"There is nothing you cannot do, my husband."
SALISH,"Well, what do you wait for, god? Your robes?"
KIRK,Take care of Miramanee.
KIRK,I am Kirok! I have come! I am Kirok!
MCCOY,I prescribed sleep.
SPOCK,"You prescribed rest, Doctor. The symbols on the obelisk are not"
MCCOY,Musical notes? You mean it's nothing but a song?
SPOCK,"In a way, yes. Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan"
MCCOY,Were you able to make sense our of the symbols?
SPOCK,"Yes. The obelisk is a marker, just as I thought. It was left by"
MCCOY,I've always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered
SPOCK,So have I. Apparently the Preservers account for a number of

MCCOY,And we have to find that deflector and put it back into working
otherwise SPOCK,"Precisely, Doctor."
SALISH,There's the false one!
ALL,Die! Die! Die!
MIRAMANEE,No! No! Don't hurt him!
KIRK,Miramanee!
MIRAMANEE,Don't hurt him! He can save us!
SALISH,He's false!
MIRAMANEE,I belong to him.
SALISH,Then go. Go die with your false god.
ALL,"You'll be killed! Kill him! We're all doomed! Die, impostor! You"
MCCOY,I need Nurse Chapel.
SPOCK,Spock to Enterprise.
SPOCK,We've located the captain. Beam down Nurse Chapel with an
KIRK,My wife. Is she all right?
MCCOY,Wife?
SPOCK,Hallucinations?
KIRK,Miramanee.
SPOCK,The nurse has given you something to ease the pain. Why were you
MIRAMANEE,Kirok could not get back into the temple.
SPOCK,"Naturally, since he did not come from there."
MIRAMANEE,"I saw him come, come."
CHAPEL,Does he recognise us?
MCCOY,His brain is unimpaired. Everything else is functionally
MCCOY,It'd take time.
SPOCK,"Time, Doctor McCoy, is the one thing we do not have in"
SPOCK,"Report noted. Doctor, is he strong enough for the Vulcan mind"
MCCOY,We have no choice.
SPOCK,I am Spock. You are James Kirk. Our minds are moving closer.
KIRK,No!
SPOCK,James Kirk.
KIRK,Miramanee! No! Miramanee!
SPOCK,Our minds are one.
BOTH,I am Kirok. I am Kirok.
SPOCK,I am Kir
KIRK,I am Kirok! I am
SPOCK,Spock!
MCCOY,What is it?
SPOCK,His mind. He is an extremely dynamic individual.
KIRK,It worked.
SPOCK,"Captain, were you inside this structure?"
KIRK,Yes. What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment.
SPOCK,This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism. It is imperative
KIRK,McCoy.
KIRK,I don't know how to get inside.
SPOCK,If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector
KIRK,The key must be in these symbols. We've got to decipher them.
SPOCK,"I already have to some extent, Captain. They are musical notes."
KIRK,You mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a
SPOCK,That would be one method. Another would be a series of tonal
KIRK,"Give me your communicator. Tonal control, consonants and vowels."
SPOCK,"If you could remember your exact words, Captain."
KIRK, Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"Scotty, if the deflector isn't activated within twenty minutes,"
SPOCK,"It is similar to deflector panels I've seen,"
KIRK,Careful. I must have hit something accidentally. A beam caught me
SPOCK,Probably a memory beam. You must have activated it out of
KIRK,More symbols. Can you read them?
SPOCK,"I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, Captain. They"
would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in theirproper KIRK,"Spock, just press the right button."
KIRK,How is she?
MCCOY,"She had bad internal injuries, Jim."
KIRK,Will she live?
MCCOY,No.
MIRAMANEE, Kirok. It is true. You are safe.
KIRK,"And so are your people, Miramanee."
MIRAMANEE,"I knew you would save them, my chief. When I am better, it"
KIRK,If that's what you want.
MIRAMANEE,We will live long and happy lives. I will bear you many
KIRK,"And I'll love you, Miramanee. Always."
MIRAMANEE,Each kiss is as the first.

KIRK,Professor Starnes? 
MCCOY,"He's dead, Captain."
KIRK,He didn't seem to know me.
MCCOY,Cyalodin.
KIRK,Self-inflicted.
KIRK,All this. Self-inflicted. Mass suicide.
MARY,You missed me.
STEVE,I did not.
TOMMY,Hi. Who are you?
KIRK,Kirk of the starship Enterprise.
TOMMY,"I'm Tommy Starnes. This is Mary, Steve, Ray, and Don."
MARY,Come on. Play with us. Come on. (They make a circle and dance
MARY,Let's go and play.
KIRK,No sign of grief?
MCCOY,"No, Jim. No indication of any kind."
KIRK,Or of fear.
MCCOY,They seem completely secure and unafraid.
KIRK,And you insist their behaviour indicates traumatic shock?
MCCOY,"I don't insist, Jim, but I can't dismiss the possibility."
KIRK,A child suppresses the fact that both parents are dead? I can't
SPOCK,Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they
KIRK,"Not these children, to this extent. It's incredible."
MCCOY,"What those children saw is incredible, Jim. The way those deaths"
KIRK,"I'll be guided by that opinion, Doctor, for the present. What"
MCCOY,Not until the fabric of the traumatisation weakens or you come
KIRK,"Accepted, Doctor."
KIRK,Careful.
DON,"I'm, I'm sorry, Captain Kirk."
KIRK,"Children. Children, listen to me. It's late and it's time to go"
DON,"Oh, not yet."
MARY,But we're just beginning to have fun.
RAY,Not now.
KIRK,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You'll go up with the doctor.
MCCOY,Come on. It's time to be going.
KIRK,Whatever happened here is locked up inside those children.
SPOCK,The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been
KIRK,Attack? Mass suicide is what it seems to be.
SPOCK,"I stand corrected, Captain. Induced would be a more precise"
KIRK,Such as?
SPOCK,The release of bacteria. Or a helpless mental depression and a
KIRK,What would make the children immune?
SPOCK,"I do not know, but it is possible."
KIRK,Then the children would have been exempted by conscious design.
SPOCK,"A valid assumption, I would say."
KIRK,And their present behaviour explained by a fear of punishment.
SPOCK,Or the promise of reward.
KIRK,An attack by an unknown assailant on an uninhabited planet. This
SPOCK,"At present, yes.  Odd."
KIRK,Getting a reading?
SPOCK,There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave.
KIRK,"Picking up any life-forms, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Definitely not humanoid, Captain. Impossible to make any"
KIRK," Oh, that's strange. That's very strange. I'm getting a"
SPOCK,"I'm not aware of it, Captain."
KIRK,Maybe that's what's registering on your tricorder.
SPOCK,"I am not familiar with anxiety, but I wasn't aware it could be"
KIRK,"No, of course. That's, that's me. That's me. But what's causing"
SPOCK,"Are you all right, Captain?"
KIRK,"Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just some sympathetic vibration with"
CHAPEL,"All right, children. Each card is a different flavour. You take"
ALL,Vanilla! Chocolate! Cherry! Banana!
CHAPEL,"Well, would you like a surprise, Stevie?"
STEVE, It's coconut and vanilla. They're both
CHAPEL,"There, there now, Stevie. There are unpleasant surprises as"
STEVE,Chocolate wobble and pistachio.
CHAPEL,"Well, coming right up."
STEVE,And peach.
CHAPEL,All right. It's going to be a wonderful surprise.
MCCOY,The tests show no evidence of tensions due
KIRK,There has to be an answer.
MCCOY,"Well, can't it wait till we get to a Starbase hospital so they"
KIRK,We're not leaving here until we find out what went on or what's
MCCOY,"Well, I won't prevent you questioning them, but it could harm"
KIRK,"It could be far worse for them if I don't, and for us too."
MCCOY,Be careful.
CHAPEL,"After this, we can all play games."
KIDS,Yeah.
CHAPEL,How do you like getting ice cream out of a computer?
MARY,That was fun.
KIRK,"Well, well, well. You're all having such a good time, I think"
MARY,Please do.
KIRK,"I'll have a dish, too."
CHAPEL,"Oh, of course."
KIRK,"A little one. A very small one. It's better than Triacus, isn't"
DON,That dirty old planet?
RAY,What's so good about that place?
STEVE,Yeah?
MARY,You weren't there very long. You don't know.
KIRK,I don't think your parents liked it very much either.
TOMMY,"Yes, they did."
STEVE,Yeah. Mine sure did.
DON,Parents like stupid things.
CHAPEL,"Oh, I don't know about that. Parents like children."
MARY,Ha. That's what you think.
KIRK,I'm sure your parents loved you. That's why they took you with
TOMMY,"Busy, busy."
ALL,Busy. Busy. Busy! Busy!
DON,Guess what we are.
CHAPEL,I know. A swarm of bees.
MARY,Watch out. Watch out. I'll sting you.
KIRK,Now wait a minute.
TOMMY,"Can we have some more ice cream, please?"
KIRK,"No, I don't think so. It'll spoil your dinner."
TOMMY,See what I told you? They all say it.
MARY,Yeah.
KIRK,"All right, children, you've had a busy day. I think you could use"
CHAPEL,"Very good idea, Captain."
MARY,"Aw, do we have to?"
KIRK,"Tommy, Just a moment. I'd like to ask you a question. Come and"
TOMMY,Saw where?
KIRK,"In the cave, on the planet. On Triacus."
TOMMY,You were there.
KIRK,Did you see your father today?
TOMMY,I saw him.
KIRK,Did he seem upset?
TOMMY,"Yeah, he was very upset."
KIRK,What about?
TOMMY,I didn't ask him.
KIRK,What was going on that would have upset him?
TOMMY,"How should I know? He was always upset, just like you, Captain"
KIRK,"I'm not upset with you, Tommy, or your friends. We invited you"
TOMMY,You have your reasons.
KIRK,Aren't you unhappy about leaving Triacus?
TOMMY,That place? That's for adults.
KIRK,Aren't you upset about leaving your parents?
TOMMY,My parents? They love it down there. Always busy. (he nearly
KIRK,"Yes, certainly. I'll take you."
TOMMY,I know the way.

KIRK,Good.
SPOCK,"Among the technical facts he gathered, Professor Starnes also"
KIRK,Let's see them.
KIRK,"Let's see some more of these unscientific hypotheses, Mister"
SPOCK,"There is another portion, Captain, which I believe you'll find"
KIRK,What happened?
SPOCK,Unknown.
KIRK,"I didn't see you come in, Tommy."
TOMMY,"Captain, after we leave here, can you take us to Marcos Twelve?"
KIRK,No. We'll probably take you to a Federation Starbase.
TOMMY,But I have relatives on Marcos Twelve.
KIRK,"I'm sorry, Tommy. Marcos Twelve is not within our patrol area."
TOMMY,"Captain, can I stay here and watch? I'll be very quiet."
KIRK,"All right, Tommy. Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy report to my"
SULU,Hi there.
TOMMY,Hi.
TOMMY,What is that?
SULU, The planet Triacus.
TOMMY,Will we see that all the time we stay here?
CHEKOV,"Yes, we will. All the time we're here."
MARY,He sees Triacus on the screen.
TOMMY,He thinks he sees it.
UHURA," Mister Sulu, the screen. We're out of orbit."
MARY,Will we reach Marcos Twelve soon?
TOMMY,Very soon.
SCOTT,When did we change course?
MAN,We haven't changed course.
SCOTT,"What do you mean, we haven't changed course? Look at your bridge"
MAN,"We're still in orbit, sir."
SCOTT,Have you gone completely blind? That's not orbiting position.
MAN,"Don't touch the controls, sir."
SCOTT,What the devil do you think you're doing?
MAN,We must remain in this orbit till the bridge orders a change.
SCOTT,You blind fool! Can't you see in front of you? We're not in
MAN,I will not disobey an order from the bridge.
SCOTT,You are disobeying an order from the bridge. Now step aside.
MAN,You're losing control of yourself.
SCOTT,Not yet.
SPOCK,"He never completed the entry, and the dispatch was never sent."
KIRK,That could be what destroyed him.
SPOCK,"Possible, Captain. Evil does seek to maintain power by"
MCCOY,Or by misleading the innocent.
KIRK,Misleading the innocent? I wonder.
MCCOY,Do you mean the children may be involved?
KIRK,"Yes, Doctor. Spock what do we know about the race that lived"
SPOCK,"According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of"
KIRK,Is that the end of it?
SPOCK,"No, like so many legends, this one too has a frightening ending."
KIRK,Is it possible that the evil found the catalyst?
SPOCK,"I was speaking of a legend, Captain."
KIRK,"But most legends have their basis in fact, Spock."
MCCOY,"I think I read you, Jim, but as medical officer I must warn you"
KIRK,"I understand your diagnosis, Doctor, and I'll respect it. But not"
KIRK,"Spock, what other expeditions have visited Triacus?"
SPOCK,"According to Federation records, this is the first."
KIRK,What was it Professor Starnes said about the unseen force?
SPOCK,"He said an unseen force was influencing him, that he recognised"
KIRK,"A ship. Yes, a ship for Triacus. But why? By whom? "
KIRK,Your tour of duty will last one hour. Be prepared with your

KIRK,"Helmsman, disregard what you see on the screen, what you think"
KIRK,"Helmsman, did you hear me?"
SULU,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starbase Four. Tell them we're bringing"
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"Lieutenant, what are you staring at?"
UHURA,I see my death. A long death. Disease and pain. I see my death.
KIRK,"Lieutenant, there's nothing there."
UHURA,"Oh, God. Captain, don't let it be."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, you make the call to Starfleet. Mister Sulu, I"
Mister Sulu SULU,"Captain, stay away from the controls! If you touch them, we'll be"
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, there's nothing there."
SPOCK,"Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet?"

SPOCK,This bridge is under complete control.
KIRK,Complete?
SPOCK,There is no need.
KIRK,Take a look around you.
SPOCK,"I cannot obey your order, Captain."
KIRK,Take Mister Sulu to his quarters. He is relieved of duty.
KIRK,Confine them to quarters. Did you hear me? Did you hear me?
SPOCK,"Captain, we must get off this bridge."
KIRK,"Yes, we must. I'm losing command. I'm losing my ability to"
KIRK,I'm losing command. I'm losing the
SPOCK,Captain.
KIRK,I've lost command. I've lost the Enterprise.
SPOCK,Jim.
KIRK,I've got command. I've got command. I've got command.
SPOCK,"Correct, Captain."
SPOCK,"Where to, Captain?"
KIRK,"Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend. This ship is off course."
KIRK,Scotty. I want you to override the bridge
SCOTT,"I can't do that, sir."
KIRK,Why not?
SCOTT,These are very sensitive instruments. I will not have you upset
KIRK,"Scotty, listen to me. The Enterprise has been invaded by alien"
KIRK,"No, I'm all right, Spock. My beast is"
SPOCK,"Captain, so long as the children are present, there is danger."
KIRK,"Spock, they're not the alien beings. They're children being"
SPOCK,"They are followers. Without followers, evil cannot spread."
KIRK,They're children.
SPOCK,"Captain, the four hundred and thirty men and women on board the"
KIRK,They don't understand the evil that they're doing.
SPOCK,"Perhaps that is true, but the evil that is within them is"
and unless we can find a way to remove it KIRK,We'll have to kill them.
KIRK,"What is it, Ensign?"
CHEKOV,I have been instructed to place you and Mister Spock under
KIRK,By whose order?
CHEKOV,"Starfleet Command, sir."
KIRK,"Where did you hear this order, Ensign? Now, listen to me. This"
CHEKOV,"I'm sorry, but I must insist you and Mister Spock come with me"
KIRK,"Ensign, listen to me."
CHEKOV," Do not force me to kill you, sir. I will"
KIRK,"Ensign, listen to me. This is a false order, Ensign."
CHEKOV,"I have never disobeyed an order, Captain. You know I have never"
KIRK,"I know that, Ensign. You have never disobeyed an order, but an"
CHEKOV,I will not disobey now! I cannot disobey!
KIRK,"Ensign, listen to me. You will disobey this order!"
KIRK,Enough. Take these men to detention then join me on the bridge.
KIRK,The Enterprise will never reach Marcos Twelve. We will not be
TOMMY,The crew will take us. The crew believes.
KIRK,The crew does not understand. When we make them understand as I
MARY,They will! They will!
TOMMY,We are going to Marcos! We are going to follow our friend!
KIRK,Your friend? Where is your friend? Where is that stowaway? Why
MARY,He will come if we call him.
TOMMY,But we won't. We don't need him. We're not afraid of you.
KIRK,Good. I'm glad you're not afraid of me.  But your
MARY,He's not afraid of anybody.
TOMMY,He's not afraid of anything.
KIRK,"He's afraid to be seen. And when the crew sees and hears him,"
TOMMY,He is our friend.
KIRK,Then let him show himself. Bring him out! Let him prove to me
TOMMY,No!
KIRK,"Mister Spock, playback the chant the children sang to summon up"
KIRK,The time has come to see the world as it is. Come on.
GORGAN,Who has summoned me?
KIRK,"I did, Gorgan. My beast is gone. It lost its power in the light"
GORGAN,"No, Captain. I command here. My followers are strong and"
SPOCK,You take from those who do not know you.
KIRK,And we know you.
GORGAN,"Then you know I must win, Captain."
KIRK,Not if we join together to fight you.
GORGON,"Foolish. You will be destroyed. I would ask you to join me, but"
KIRK,We're also very strong.
GORGAN,"Ah, but your strength is cancelled by your gentleness. You are"
KIRK,"Children, I have pictures of some of you on Triacus. I'd like to"
GORGAN,I forbid it.
SPOCK,Why should you fear it?
GORGAN,I fear nothing.
KIRK,"So we were told. Mister Spock, the pictures. The children are"
GORGAN,They would not help transport us. They were against us. They
SPOCK,"Tommy's father would have destroyed you, but he recognised you"
GORGAN,You are also too late. The kind ones always are.
KIRK,"Not always, Gorgan. Not this time. You can't hide from them. They"
GORGAN,You are my future generals. Together we can raise armies of
KIRK,"Don't be afraid. Look at him. Without you children, he's nothing."
GORGAN,I command you! I command you! To your posts! Carry out your
KIRK,Look how ugly he really is. Look at him and don't be afraid.
GORGAN,Death. Death to you all. Death to you all. Death to you all.
KIRK,It's all right.
MCCOY,"They're crying, Jim. I don't know how it happened, but it's good"
KIRK,"It's all right, Mary. It's all right. It's all right, isn't it,"
MCCOY,Yes. It's all right. We can help them now.
SULU,"Marcos Twelve dead ahead, sir."
KIRK,"Reverse course, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Aye, sir."
SULU,"Course reversed, Captain."
KIRK,"Set course for Starbase Four, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Yes, sir."
Original Airdate,"18 Oct, 1968"
KIRK,"Mister Marvick. I am James Kirk, the Captain."
MARVICK,"Captain, what are you doing here? You'll have to leave before"
KIRK,"Yes, everything will be taken care of. This is Mister Spock, my"
SCOTT,"Montgomery Scott, Chief Engineer. Call me Scotty."
MARVICK,"Mister Spock, do you have the visor? You must be sure to wear"
SPOCK,"Thank you, Mister Marvick. I shall be wearing the visor."
KIRK,We mustn't keep the ambassador waiting. If you'll go with Mister
SCOTT,"Aye, indeed. It's a rare privilege meeting one of the designers"
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to transporter control centre on"
KIRK,This is Captain Kirk. Inform the ambassador and Doctor Jones
SPOCK,It has proved effective for Vulcans.
KIRK,It's your human half I'm worried about.
SPOCK,I shall endeavour to keep it under control.
KIRK,Inform me when transport is complete.
SPOCK,"Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos. I am First Officer Spock."
MIRANDA,I'm Doctor Jones.  The ambassador is
SPOCK,"Captain Kirk, we are ready."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to all"
UHURA,"Channel open, sir."
KIRK,This is Captain Kirk to all ship's personnel. Clearance plans now
SPOCK,"Doctor Jones, may I congratulate you on your assignment with"
MIRANDA,"Thank you, but the assignment's not yet definite. It will"
SPOCK,I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience.
MIRANDA,I wasn't aware that anyone had ever achieved a mind-link with
SPOCK,No one ever has. I was referring to mind-links I had attempted
MIRANDA,"I've heard, Mister Spock, that you turned down the assignment"
SPOCK,I was unable to accept. My life is here.
SPOCK,Spock to Bridge. We have arrived at the Ambassador's quarters.
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock. Notify all hands to"
SULU,"Warp factor two, sir."
SPOCK,I would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the
MIRANDA,I'm sure the Ambassador would be charmed.
SPOCK,I almost envy you your assignment.
MIRANDA,I see in your mind that you are tempted to take my place.
SPOCK,"Not correct, Doctor, although I am aware of your mind attempting"
MIRANDA,Yes. That is why I had to study on Vulcan.
SPOCK,I understand. May I show you to your quarters?
MIRANDA,I think I'll stay here a bit. Ambassador Kollos often finds
SPOCK,I understand. Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint.
MIRANDA,What is it he sees when he looks at you? I must know!
KIRK,I can't understand why they let you go with Kollos.
MIRANDA,"They, Captain?"
KIRK,The male population of the Federation. Didn't someone try and
MIRANDA,"Now that you ask, yes."
KIRK,"Well, I'm glad he didn't succeed. Otherwise, I wouldn't have met"
MIRANDA,"Thank you, Captain."
KIRK,"Tell me, Doctor Jones. Why isn't it dangerous for you to be with"
SPOCK,"Why, thank you, Captain."
KIRK,"You're very welcome, Mister Spock. But no human can look at"
MIRANDA,I spent four years on Vulcan studying their mental discipline.
MCCOY,You poor girl.
SPOCK,"On the contrary, Doctor, I would say that Doctor Jones was"
MCCOY,Vulcan is not my idea of fun.
MIRANDA,"Joy can be many things, Doctor. On Vulcan, I learned to do"
KIRK,To read minds?
MIRANDA,"How not to read them, Captain."
KIRK,I don't understand.
SPOCK,"Doctor Jones was born a telepath, Captain."
KIRK,Oh.
MIRANDA,Vulcan was necessary to my sanity.
SPOCK,What most humans generally find impossible to understand is the
JONES,Or of their own thoughts and emotions. I was just noticing your
KIRK,"Well, I doubt that Mister Spock would don the most revered of all"
SPOCK,"As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honour you,"
MIRANDA,Indeed?
KIRK,"Yes, very interesting. I might even say fascinating, but back to"
MIRANDA,The key is the mind-link that I learned on Vulcan. Once we
MCCOY,I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are supposed to be.
SPOCK,"I see, Doctor McCoy, you still subscribe to the outmoded notion,"
MARVICK,"And the reverse, of course, that what is beautiful is"
KIRK,"Yes, I think most of us are attracted by beauty and repelled by"
MCCOY,How can one so beautiful condemn herself to look upon ugliness
ALL,Certainly not.
MIRANDA,"How can one so full of joy and the love of life as you,"
MCCOY,"To whatever you want the most, Miranda."
KIRK,Some more Antarean brandy?  What is it?
MIRANDA,There's somebody nearby thinking of murder.
KIRK,In this room?
MIRANDA,It's gone now.
KIRK,Who is it? Can you tell?
MIRANDA,"It isn't there anymore. Captain, would you mind if I said"
KIRK,Of course. Perhaps I'll see
SPOCK,I'll escort you to your quarters.
MIRANDA,"Thank you, gentlemen. You make a choice impossible. Please,"
KIRK,"Sleep well, Miranda."
MCCOY,Are you sure you're well enough to find your way alone?
MIRANDA,"Of course, Doctor McCoy. Please don't worry about me."
MCCOY,"Now, where I come from, that's what we call a lady."
KIRK,"Yes, she is something special."
MARVICK,Very special. I suggest you treat her accordingly. I've known
SCOTT,"Larry, would you like to stop off at Engineering with me? I have"
MARVICK,Some other time.
SCOTT,"Good night, gentlemen."
KIRK,"Good night, Scotty. You dressed up for the occasion, Spock. Very"
SPOCK,"I genuinely intended to honour her, Captain. Good evening,"
KIRK,Good evening. Sleep well.
KIRK,"Bones, what's troubling you with the girl?"
MCCOY,"Well, she's not just another girl, Captain. Don't make that"
KIRK,I didn't think that for a moment. What else?
MCCOY,"I don't know what it is, exactly. She seems very vulnerable."
KIRK,We're all vulnerable in one way or another.
MCCOY,Of course. But there's something so very disturbing about her.
KIRK,Meaning she's quite a woman. I agree.
MCCOY,"Good night, Jim."
KIRK,"Good night, Bones."
MIRANDA,Who is it?
MIRANDA,It's late.
MIRANDA,"All right. Come in, then."
MARVICK,I thought the dinner was never going to end.
MIRANDA,I rather enjoyed it.
MARVICK,"Yes, I know you did. I didn't. You were so far away."
MIRANDA,I'll be further away than that soon.
MARVICK,"Please don't talk of that. There's so little time. Please,"
MIRANDA,"Now, we've been over this time and time again."
MARVICK,"Don't I know it. I've asked you in restaurants, in the"
MIRANDA,"Larry, please, try to understand."
MARVICK,"I understand that you're a woman and that I'm a man, one of"
MIRANDA,I've been honest with you. I simply cannot love you the way
MARVICK,Miranda.
MIRANDA,And I'm going away with Kollos. That's final. I think you'd
MIRANDA,So it's you! I didn't know that it was you before. Who is it
MARVICK,So now you want to help me. Now I know what a mere human male
KIRK,Miranda!
MARVICK,Where's Mister Scott?
KIRK,Miranda?
SCOTT,"Ah, there, Marvick. So you couldn't resist a wee wager."
KIRK,Has the Ambassador been hurt?
MIRANDA,"No harm has come to the Ambassador, Captain."
KIRK,Who could have done such a thing?
MIRANDA,Larry Marvick.
KIRK,Larry Marvick? Why?
SPOCK,Do you know whether he saw the Medusan?
MIRANDA,"Yes, he did."
SPOCK,"Then insanity will surely be the result, Captain. Dangerous"
SCOTT,"The controls are all yours, and the bottle"
KIRK,"Explain, Lieutenant Sulu."
SULU,"I don't believe this myself, Captain, but we're travelling at"
CHEKOV,And accelerating.
KIRK,"Get engineering, Uhura."
UHURA,"They don't answer, Captain."
SULU,Warp factor nine and accelerating.
KIRK,"Can't you disengage power from there, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Trying, Captain. Mister Chekov, your assistance, please."
UHURA,"Captain, I have engineering now."
KIRK,Put them on intercom.
KIRK,Security to engineering.
MIRANDA,I'll go with you.
KIRK,No.
MIRANDA,I must. I can reach his mind.
MARVICK,We'll be safe at the boundaries of the
KIRK,"Scotty, where are we?"
SCOTT,I don't know!
MARVICK,Beyond the boundaries of the galaxy. We made it. We're safe.
KIRK,Bones.
MARVICK,"Oh, no. No! No, Captain. We mustn't sleep. No! No! No, they"
KIRK,All right. All right.
MARVICK,No.
KIRK,We'll take you to a place to hide.
MARVICK,No.
MIRANDA,"Yes, Larry. I'm here."
MARVICK,"I didn't lose you. Oh, my beautiful love, I thought I'd lost"
MIRANDA,"I am here, Larry. No. I can see what he sees. No, don't. Don't"
MARVICK,Liar! Liar! Deceiver! You're not alone! You brought it with
MCCOY,"He's dead, Jim."
KIRK,Where are we?
SPOCK,"We are evidently far outside our own galaxy, judging from the"
MCCOY,"I have the autopsy report on Marvick. Heart action stopped,"
KIRK,You mean he just simply died.
MCCOY,I mean he evidently could not live with what he saw.
KIRK,"Or what he felt. Damage report, Scotty?"
SCOTT,"We need some repairs, sir, but the ship is intact."
KIRK,"Position report, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Impossible to calculate. We lack data to analyse. Our
KIRK,Then we should be able to navigate back.
SPOCK,"Unfortunately, we lack reference points on which to plot a"
CHEKOV,"A madman got us into this, and it's beginning to look as if"
SPOCK,"An entertaining suggestion, Mister Chekov, but not very helpful."
SPOCK,Very possibly. The Medusan sensory system is radically different
KIRK,Explain.
SPOCK,A fusion. A mind-link to create a double entity. Each of us
KIRK,Hazards?
SPOCK,If the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose
MCCOY,I don't think she'll want anyone to intrude in the kind of
SPOCK,Doctor Jones has shown reluctance every time I've asked to
KIRK,I could confine her to quarters.
SPOCK,Not sufficient. Her telepathic powers are formidable. If it is
KIRK,I think that could be arranged.
KIRK,"I may be sentimental, but this is my favourite place. Earth."
MIRANDA,I've never been to Earth. What lovely flowers. May I touch
KIRK,Certainly.
MIRANDA,They have no scent.
KIRK,Try these.
KIRK,Let me see. It's just a thorn. I was hoping to make you forget
MIRANDA,It doesn't hurt anymore.
KIRK,You mustn't blame yourself because Marvick loved you.
MIRANDA,I didn't want his love. I couldn't return it.
KIRK,"But someday, you will want human love and companionship."
MIRANDA,Shall I tell you what human companionship means to me? A
KIRK,Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with the Medusans
MIRANDA,Perhaps.
KIRK,"A meeting of minds is all very well, but what about love,"
MIRANDA,Ugly. What is ugly? Who is to say whether Kollos is too ugly
KIRK,"Miranda, I meant no insult. Please. Here we are among the roses."
MIRANDA,I see you're a very complicated man.
MIRANDA,"Kollos, no. You mustn't let him!"
KIRK,"Miranda, don't."
MIRANDA,Let me go. You have no idea what a dangerous thing Spock is
SPOCK,The Enterprise is at stake. It is not possible for you to be
MIRANDA,Why? I've already committed myself to mind-link when Kollos
SPOCK,This is not a duty that you can assume. I am aware of the fact
MIRANDA,Then teach me to operate the ship. I can memorise instantly.
MCCOY,Now wait a minute. I realise that you can do almost anything a
KIRK,What?
SPOCK,Fascinating.
MCCOY,"I'm sorry, Miranda, but you must be realistic. You are blind,"
SPOCK,Evidently a highly sophisticated sensor web. My compliments to
KIRK,"Yes, of course. It's the only reasonable explanation. You can't"
SPOCK,An elegant solution. but I fail to understand why you apparently
KIRK,I think I understand. You said it. Pity is the worst of all.
MIRANDA,"Pity, which I hate. Do you think you can gather more"
KIRK,"No, that won't be necessary. Mister Spock will make the"
MIRANDA,No. I won't let you.
MCCOY,"Please. Do not fight us like this, Doctor Jones. I appeal to you"
MIRANDA,No.
KIRK,"If we can't persuade you, there is someone who can. You'll have"
KIRK,"Bones, why hadn't you told me?"
MCCOY,She would have told you herself if she had wanted you to know. I
KIRK,"Yes, there's a great deal to respect about that lady."
MIRANDA,It seems I have no choice but to obey you.
SPOCK,"This is delightful. I know you. All of you. James Kirk, Captain"
MCCOY,That's not Spock.
SPOCK,"Are you surprised to find that I've read Byron, Doctor?"
MCCOY,That's Spock!
KIRK,Am I addressing the Ambassador?
SPOCK,"In part. That is, part of us is known to you as Kollos. Ah,"
MIRANDA,'Tis new to thee.
SPOCK,"My world is next for us. Captain Kirk, I speak for all of us you"
KIRK,"We don't hold you to blame for what happened, and thank you now"
SPOCK,"And now to the business at hand. With your permission, Captain."
KIRK,"Yes. Mister Sulu, release the helm to Mister Spock."
SULU,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,Co-ordination is completed.
KIRK,"Then go ahead, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Warp one in six seconds. Five, four, three, two, one, zero."
SPOCK,"Position report, please, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,Our position? Our position is so close to the point where we
SPOCK,"Thank you, Mister Chekov. Manoeuvre completed, Captain."
KIRK,"Take over, Mister Sulu. Thank you, Ambassador. Mister Chekov,"
CHEKOV,"The new headings will be plotted in a minute, sir."
SPOCK,How compact your bodies are. And what a variety of senses you
KIRK,"Ambassador, you must dissolve the link."
SPOCK,So soon?
KIRK,There must be no delay.
SPOCK,You're a wise Captain.
SULU,Captain.
KIRK,Spock! Don't look! Cover your eyes!
KIRK,Don't move!
MCCOY,"But, Jim."
KIRK,No one is to move. Spock? Are you all right?
MCCOY,He's hardly breathing. Help me get him to Sickbay.
MCCOY,Unless Miranda can look down into his mind and turn it outward
KIRK, Vulcan mind techniques. They seem so untrustworthy now
MCCOY,Her knowledge of them may be the only thing that could save
KIRK,But does she want to? She's been in there so long.
MCCOY,There's nothing else to be done.
KIRK,She tried to help Marvick. Marvick is dead.
MCCOY,That's different. Marvick loved her.
KIRK,And Spock is her rival. Is that any better? Even Spock felt the
MCCOY,"But they weren't rivals in love. Jim, you shouldn't go in there."
KIRK,"Whatever happens, Bones, don't interfere."
MIRANDA,Who is it? Doctor McCoy? Who's there?
KIRK,Captain Kirk.
MIRANDA,"I have no news for you, Captain."
KIRK,No change?
MIRANDA,Only that his life processes are ebbing.
KIRK,What are you doing about it?
MIRANDA,"Why, what I can, of course."
KIRK,Which doesn't seem to be much.
MIRANDA,No doubt you think I can wake him with a kiss.
KIRK,"It's worth a try, isn't it? After all, he's not a machine."
MIRANDA,But he is a Vulcan.
KIRK,"Only half. The other half is human. Far more human than you,"
MIRANDA,"Face reality, Captain. His mind has gone down almost too far"
KIRK,"If you don't reach him soon, he'll die. But that's what you want,"
MIRANDA,That's a lie!
KIRK,Oh yes? You want him to die. What did you do to him on the
MIRANDA,You're insane!
KIRK,"Yes, you know your rival, don't you? You couldn't keep him from"
MIRANDA,That's a lie! Liar!
KIRK,Your desire to see Kollos is madness! You can never see him.
MIRANDA,"Sadistic, filthy liar!"
KIRK,"The smell of hatred, the stench of jealousy permeates you. Why"
MIRANDA,"Don't say anymore, please!"
KIRK,"Kollos knows what's in your heart. You can lie to yourself, but"
MIRANDA,Please go away!
MCCOY,What'd you say to her?
KIRK,Maybe too much.
MCCOY,What's she doing in there?
KIRK,"You may be right, Bones. Maybe I shouldn't have gone in. She was"
MIRANDA,"Now, Spock, this is to the death. Or to"
KIRK,Spock.
MCCOY,You look like you've paid a visit to the devil himself.
KIRK,Miranda.
MCCOY,You have what you wanted most.
MIRANDA,I am one with Kollos.
MCCOY,"Well, I'm truly sorry that you're leaving. Goodbye."
MIRANDA,"We come to the end of an eventful trip, Captain."
KIRK,I didn't think you'd even talk to me.
MIRANDA,"Well, I have you to thank for my future. Your words enabled me"
KIRK,"Miranda, good luck, Health. I have something for you."
MIRANDA,I suppose it has thorns.
KIRK,I never met a rose that didn't.
MIRANDA, I know now the great joy you felt when you joined
SPOCK,I rejoice in your knowledge and in your achievement.
MIRANDA,"I understand, Mister Spock. The glory of creation is in its"
SPOCK,And the ways our differences combine to create meaning and
MIRANDA,"Peace and long life, Spock."
SPOCK,"Live long and prosper, Miranda."
KIRK,Peace.
Original Airdate,"25 Oct, 1968"
SPOCK,On mark eight and closing.
KIRK,"Steady as she goes. Phaser crew, stand by."
CHEKOV,"Range, forty five thousand kilometres, Captain."
SPOCK,Fascinating.
CHEKOV,"Range, forty three thousand kilometres and closing."
KIRK,Sensor readings?
SPOCK,A mechanical device of unknown properties. I read no life forms
KIRK,"Analysis, Science Officer?"
SPOCK,"Obviously, it intends to intercept us. It has made several"
CHEKOV,Thirty eight thousand and closing. Thirty five thousand and
SPOCK,Unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with
KIRK,"Thank you, Science Officer. Come to one eight one mark seven."
CHEKOV,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,It's staying with us.
SPOCK,Indeed.
KIRK,"Full stop, Mister Chekov. Hold your position."
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,"Vulcan, Captain."
KIRK,English.
CHEKOV,"It was Russian, sir. Every word."
UHURA,"No, Captain. It was Swahili."
KIRK,Interesting. Telepathy.
SPOCK,Unquestionably. Most impressive.
KIRK,Our orders are very clear. We're to establish contact with the
SPOCK,"True telepaths can be most formidable, and we have been warned."
KIRK,What previous contacts have been made with the Melkotians?
SPOCK,"No recorded contacts. If they ever ventured into space, they"
KIRK,"Lieutenant, hailing frequencies."
UHURA,"Tied in, sir."
KIRK,"This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise,"
UHURA,"Nothing, sir. Clear on all frequencies."
KIRK,Try again.
UHURA,"Still no response, sir."
KIRK,"Opinion, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"I prefer being a welcomed guest, Captain, but there seems to be"
KIRK,"None whatsoever. Mister Chekov, deflectors at full intensity."
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir. Standard orbit in five minutes."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, advise Doctor McCoy and Engineer Scott to meet"
KIRK,"Spock, what is this?"
SPOCK,"Unknown, Captain. Sensor readings give no indication of fog like"
MCCOY,I knew it had to happen. It's a fine time for that transporter
SCOTT,"Impossible, Doctor McCoy. My transporter was working perfectly."
CHEKOV,Then what are we doing here?
KIRK,"Tricorder readings, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Unknown, Captain. Unlike Mister Scott's transporter, this unit"
KIRK,Then let's get out of here. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to
SPOCK,"No use, Captain. Obviously none of our devices will function."
Apparently that Melkotian buoy MELKOT, Aliens. Our warning was plain.
KIRK,"We come in peace, but we'll defend ourselves if necessary."
MELKOT,You are outside. You are disease. The disease must be
SPOCK,Fascinating.
CHEKOV,"Where are we now, Captain?"
KIRK,"Spock, evaluation?"
SPOCK,Obviously this represents the Melkotian's concept of an American
MCCOY,It's just bits and pieces. It's incomplete.
SPOCK,Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era.
KIRK,Or perhaps this is all they require to complete the pattern of
SCOTT,"And these, Captain? "
KIRK,Beautiful specimen.
SPOCK,Crude but dangerous.
KIRK,"Whatever the Melkotians have planned for us, it won't be"
MCCOY,"In the midst of what seems so unreal, the harsh reality. This is"
KIRK," October 26, 1881. Tombstone,"
MCCOY,"Tombstone. Hell for leather, right out of history."
KIRK,But why here? And why now?
SPOCK,"Captain, the Melkot said you were the pattern. He looked into"
KIRK,Because my ancestors pioneered the American frontier.
SPOCK,Yes. The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for
MCCOY,What's the matter with us? We're talking like we really are in
SPOCK,"Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us."
KIRK,"There's something about that date, October 26, 1881 But what was"
BEHAN,"Ike! Ike! Frank! Billy! Tom!  Ike, I was"
KIRK,Looks like we did.
BEHAN,I knew you wouldn't let them scare you away. They're a bunch of

BEHAN,Now they're going to have to fight after the way they shot off
KIRK,You know us?
BEHAN,"Funny. That's what I like about you, lke. You always see the"
KIRK,I'm a barrel of laughs.
BEHAN,Nobody can say Johnny Behan doesn't have a sense of humour.
KIRK,"Johnny? He called me lke, you Frank, Bones Tom, and Billy. Ike"
SPOCK,"Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history."
KIRK,"In the late nineteenth century in Arizona, two factions fought"
SPOCK,"And the Clanton gang. On October 26th, they had it out."
CHEKOV,Who won?
KIRK,"The Clantons lost, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,And we are the Clantons?
KIRK,We are the Clantons. And if this is a replay of history
SPOCK,History cannot be changed.
SCOTT,It's impossible! Things like this can't happen.
SPOCK,"Is this a dead man, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"Very dead, Mister Spock."
KIRK,That's one thing we can be sure of. Death is real.
BARMAN,"Ike, Frank, hiya, boys. I didn't think I'd see you again."
SYLVIA,"Billy! Oh, Billy!  Billy, baby, I knew they"
CHEKOV,"Oh, you knew that?"
SYLVIA,Come on.
SYLVIA,Maybe you shouldn't have.
CHEKOV,And pass up an opportunity to see you? Don't be silly.
SYLVIA,It's taking crazy chances with Morgan Earp right in the same
KIRK,"Yes, of course. The man who kills on sight. Morgan Earp."
SPOCK,"Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in"
BARMAN,You boys want your usual?
SCOTT,Absolutely. Half a gallon of scotch.
BARMAN,"You know we ain't got nothing but bourbon, unless you want corn"
SYLVIA,I wish it was all over. I saw Virgil out patrolling this
KIRK,Good old Virgil. We can always count on him.
SYLVIA,They've been blowing off all over town about how they chased
KIRK,I don't think we're going to have any choice.
MORGAN,You'll dirty yourself with this scum. Come on.
CHEKOV,Get your hands off her.
MORGAN,"Now, Claiborne."
KIRK,"No, no, no. All right, all right, all right. We don't want any"
MORGAN,"If you don't want any trouble, what are you doing in my town?"
KIRK,"Just leave us alone, Mister Earp. That's all we ask."
MORGAN,"Five of you. You'd like me to draw, wouldn't you? All right, I"
SPOCK,I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with
BARMAN," Close, Ike. Lucky there wasn't"
KIRK,I guess so.
BARMAN,Sylvia's right. They've been bad-mouthing something fierce all
SPOCK,"I assure you, sir, we shall watch it, and everything, extremely"
SYLVIA,"Billy, you were wonderful. "
KIRK,"Er, Mister Chekov?"
CHEKOV,"What can I do, Captain? You know we're always supposed to"
KIRK,Young lady. Young lady.
SYLVIA,"Yes, Ike?"
KIRK,"I'd like to talk to Mister, to Billy alone, if you don't mind."
SYLVIA,"All right. I understand. Billy Claiborne, you be careful."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, you be careful. Mister Spock, except for our hand"
CHEKOV,"I don't think that's such a bad thing, Captain."
SPOCK,"The day is still young, Ensign."
KIRK,"All right, what have we got? We're here in Tombstone, Arizona,"
SPOCK,"And if this is indeed some sort of replay of history, the Earps"
KIRK,"Well, we're not going to be at the OK Corral at five o'clock this"
BARMAN,I ain't making no big claims about you to nobody. Just so
KIRK,Take a close look at me.
BARMAN,Yeah?
KIRK,Who do you think I am?
BARMAN,Ike Clanton. Who do you think you are?
KIRK,"I know this is hard to understand, but I'm Captain James T. Kirk"
BARMAN,No.
KIRK,Do these clothes look like yours?
BARMAN,Not exactly.
KIRK,Have you seen clothes like this before?
BARMAN,Sure.
KIRK,Where?
BARMAN,On the Clantons. You Clantons are always great with your jokes.
KIRK,I'm not joking.
BARMAN,The only difference between you and the Earps is that they
KIRK,I'm not joking! I'm not Ike Clanton!
BARMAN,"It's okay with me, Ike. Anything you say. Don't make no"
KIRK,"Good morning, gentlemen. My name's James Kirk. I'm afraid there's"
WYATT,"Clanton, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but we warned"
KIRK,"Yes, of course you did, and I wanted to talk to you about that."
MORGAN,"We're done talking, Clanton."
KIRK,"There's been some sort of mistake, a misunderstanding."
WYATT,"All right, Clanton. One more chance. Your last. You've got until"
KIRK,Yes. We'd be glad to. We don't want to fight.
MORGAN,"I always said you was yellow, Clanton."
KIRK,"I'll make one more attempt to get through to you, Mister Earp. My"
MORGAN,"Oh, yeah. We heard the talk about your jokes."
KIRK,I'm not joking.
MORGAN,"Sure. Well, I'm glad to meet you Mister Kirk."
WYATT,"Draw, Clanton."
KIRK,"Not me, Mister Earp."
WYATT,You draw or I will.
MORGAN,"No, Wyatt. Let me. When the time comes, I'll pay him for this."
KIRK,We don't want any trouble. We'll be glad to co-operate.
WYATT,"Five o'clock, Clanton. Is that clear? If you're in town at five"
MCCOY,What's the matter?
KIRK,What do you call that stuff? Fire?
MCCOY,"Taos Lightning straight bourbon. Try some. In small amounts, it"
KIRK,Label it for external use Only.
SCOTT,"It just takes a bit of getting used to, Captain. Actually, a man"
MCCOY,"Take it easy, Mister Scott. I hate to think what that stuff's"
KIRK,And your reflexes. We're going to need fast reflexes from now on.
SCOTT,Aye. If we only had a phaser.
MCCOY,Or a communicator. It'd be a pleasure to watch those Earps as we
KIRK,Could we make a communicator?
SPOCK,"Impossible, Captain. In this century, there are no metal alloys"
KIRK,"The problem is clear, Spock. We're going to have to seek"
SPOCK,"Mister Chekov is involved, Captain."
SYLVIA,"You shouldn't have come back to town, Billy. Morgan'll kill you"
CHEKOV,"With his outdated weapon? If he shoots at me, I will just step"
SYLVIA,You can joke about it. I've seen them in action. Especially
CHEKOV,A lot of people and things have tried to kill me. You'd be
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, I mean Billy. Come along."
CHEKOV,"Yes, sir."
SYLVIA,"Billy? Please, don't even go near him."
KIRK,Gentlemen.
CHEKOV,"Where are we going, Captain?"
KIRK,To exercise the better part of valour.
KIRK,"Well, that settles that. A force field."
SPOCK,It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave
SCOTT,If we could only contact the Enterprise.
CHEKOV,"Yes, but where is the Enterprise?"
KIRK,"Mister Chekov. If you were in charge of the Enterprise, what"
CHEKOV,I'd be using the ship's sensors trying to locate us.
KIRK,"Very good. If we could find the place where we beamed down, the"
MCCOY,Well let's get there.
SPOCK,"There's no way we can know where it is, Doctor."
KIRK,It could be anywhere within a thousand mile radius.
MCCOY,"Mister Spock, why don't you join us common humanoids in trying"
KIRK,We have until five o'clock to find that way. Now consider this.
SCOTT," We have these, Captain."
KIRK,"No, the Melkots gave us those to execute us. We have to find a"
CHEKOV,All those western Cossacks had were poisonous snakes and cactus
KIRK,"Bones, the venom, the plants. Can you make use of them?"
MCCOY,"A tranquilliser. Of course, Jim. I can make a tranquilliser!"
SPOCK,I could make a device to deliver it on target.
KIRK,"First, Bones, the ingredients you require."
MCCOY,I know the place to get the proper drugs. I'll need a mortar and
KIRK,"Chekov, mortar and pestle."
KIRK,How do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target?
SPOCK,I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding.
KIRK,Cotton wadding. Try the apothecary.
SCOTT,Aye. 
SPOCK,I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating
BARBER,I'll be about five minutes yet. You could come back.
MCCOY,"Well, thank you. Mind if I look around a bit? (checking the"
BARBER,I wouldn't touch that stuff if I was you.
MCCOY,"Oh, you don't have to worry. I know how to handle this. I have"
BARBER,That stuff ain't mine. It belongs to him. You'd better ask him.
MCCOY,"Oh, so you're the dentist. Well, I'm a physician, and I have a"
HOLLIDAY,You want it now?
MCCOY,My name is McCoy. I'm a doctor.
HOLLIDAY,"That joke is all around town already, McLowery. But my name"
MCCOY,The emergency is real. I need these things.
HOLLIDAY,"Your emergency sure is real. Go on, take the stuff. Have some"
MCCOY,"That is my intention, Doctor."
HOLLIDAY,"Because at one minute past five, you'll find a hole in your"
SYLVIA,Ahem.
CHEKOV,Sylvia! Hello.
SYLVIA,"Billy Claiborne, you know how crazy I am about you."
CHEKOV,That's very nice.
SYLVIA,"Well, aren't you going to ask me what I've got in my shopping"
CHEKOV,That's just what I was preparing to inquire. Have you been
SYLVIA,"Of course, silly! What else would I be doing on a beautiful"
CHEKOV,"No, no, I haven't forgotten. I am looking forward to it most"
SYLVIA,You will be absolutely wild when you see me in the new gown I'm
CHEKOV,Married? I'm afraid that wouldn't be possible.
SYLVIA,But I'm positive the gown will be ready. What else is there to
CHEKOV,But it is absolutely impossible. I am not someone you can
SYLVIA,"Do you think I don't know? Billy Claiborne, you are a cattle"
MORGAN,"I warned you, Claiborne. Stay away."
MORGAN,"You don't have to take anything from that scum, not while I'm"
CHEKOV,Mister Earp. Get your hands off her.
MCCOY,"There's nothing I can do, Jim."
WYATT,"Come on, Clanton. Let's do it now."
SCOTT,"Captain, let me."
KIRK,No.
HOLLIDAY,"Yeah, come on, Captain. Let him."
SCOTT,"Captain, we can't just stand here and take it."
KIRK,"Yes, we can."
SCOTT,But they murdered Chekov! If you think I'm going to
KIRK,"Scotty, they're trying to push us into something we're not ready"
SPOCK,And it is not yet our time.
MCCOY,"Let it go, Jim. He's dead."
KIRK,Maybe he wouldn't be if I hadn't ignored the Melkot warning.
MCCOY,We all knew the risk when we joined the service. Now let it go.
SPOCK,"Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate"
KIRK,"But not this minute, Spock. It takes us a little longer."
SPOCK,"I understand the feeling, Captain."
MCCOY,"You talk about another man's feelings. What do you feel, Spock?"
SPOCK,"My feelings are not a subject for discussion, Doctor."
MCCOY,Because there are no feelings to discuss.
SCOTT,"Mister Spock, Chekov is dead! I say it now, and I can hardly"
MCCOY,"Spock will have no truck with grief, Scotty. It's human."
KIRK,"Bones, Scotty."
SPOCK,"Captain, it's quite all right. They forget I am half human."
MCCOY,We don't have much time.
SPOCK,Captain. I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous
KIRK,About what?
SPOCK,"Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang. You,"
KIRK,"William Claiborne, that's right."
SPOCK,But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the OK
MCCOY,"Get to the point, Spock."
SPOCK,"Mister Chekov is dead. But in the actual gunfight, William"
KIRK,"Yes. Yes, that's right. That means it doesn't have to happen the"
MCCOY,I'll have it ready before Spock.
KIRK,Spock?
SPOCK,Another hour.
KIRK,And we'll have a tranquilliser grenade?
SPOCK,Not precisely.
KIRK,Forget precision. Will it work?
SPOCK,It should.
KIRK,"Make sure it does, Spock. If we don't tranquillise them, we'll"
MCCOY,"And if we fight them, we all die. We know that."
SPOCK,"Negotiating with them could buy us more time, Captain."
KIRK,But not with the Earps. I've tried that. That's out. There must
SPOCK,"It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the"
KIRK,Not with the Earps. There is one other place I can try.
BEHAN,You looking for somebody?
KIRK,"Yes, Sheriff. I want you to stop the fight."
BEHAN,Stop it? Who wants to stop it? I sure don't. You don't. You
KIRK,I do now.
BEHAN,Since when does a Clanton run crawling to the law for help?
KIRK,How else is he going to get justice?
BEHAN, From this. You and your boys set up this whole
KIRK,It's not too late. Sheriff. Sheriff. There must be plenty of
BEHAN,Don't talk nonsense. The people in this town are counting on you
KIRK,Then the people had better wake up and let the law work for them.
BEHAN,You can talk that way after what the Earps did to Billy today?
KIRK,"Yes, I want revenge. I want to crush the life out of the Earps."
BEHAN,You listen to me. Get down to the OK Corral. Keep out of sight.
KIRK,Can't I get it through your stupid head? I can't just kill them!
BEHAN,It's the only way.
KIRK,I can't kill them! I can't kill them!
BEHAN,Kill them any way you can! There'll be no questions asked.
SPOCK,These crude supplies we were forced to use
MCCOY,I doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any
SPOCK,"Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor."
SPOCK,Captain?
KIRK,How soon will that be ready?
SPOCK,Right now.
KIRK,Good. How long will it take the tranquilliser to have effect?
MCCOY,Three or four seconds.
KIRK,How did you manage to test it?
SPOCK,It has not been tested.
MCCOY,"It's not necessary, Captain. It's very simple. Nothing can go"
KIRK,"Up to now, everything has gone wrong. I want it tested now."
SCOTT,Would a volunteer solve the problem?
MCCOY,It would.
SCOTT,All right. On one condition. That I'm wide awake and with you at
MCCOY,Guaranteed.
SCOTT,Aye.  It's to kill the pain.
SPOCK,But this is painless.
SCOTT,"Well, you should've warned me sooner, Mister Spock. Fire away."
MCCOY,"It should have worked. Did you inhale the gas, Scotty?"
SCOTT,Aye. Deeply.
MCCOY,You still feel all right?
SCOTT,I never felt better.
MCCOY,No dizziness? No sweating? No palpitations?
KIRK,It doesn't work.
SPOCK,Fascinating.
KIRK,It was our last chance.
SPOCK,"Captain, you don't seem to understand. It did not function, but"
MCCOY,"Nothing could go wrong, Captain. It should work."
SPOCK,"A scientific fact But if the tranquilliser does not function,"
KIRK,We need a weapon. An answer.
MCCOY,"You don't have to worry about that now, Jim. Look at the clock."
KIRK,"Ten minutes and it's all going to end at the OK Corral. Well,"
KIRK,Let's get out of here.
KIRK,"Scotty, Bones.  We're trapped. They"
SCOTT,"Good. If they want a fight, let's gie'em a fight."
KIRK,They're experts at gunfighting. We don't have a chance.
MCCOY,"Then we'd better become experts, and fast."
SPOCK,That may not be necessary.
KIRK,"Spock, you've got something?"
SPOCK,"A fact, Captain. Physical laws simply cannot be ignored."
MCCOY,"What do you mean, Spock?"
SPOCK,"I mean, Doctor, that we are faced with a staggering"
KIRK,It would've been effective anywhere else.
SPOCK,"Exactly. Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mister Chekov?"
MCCOY,A piece of lead in his body.
SPOCK,Wrong. His mind killed him.
MCCOY,"Come on, Spock. If you've got the answer, tell us."
SPOCK,Physical reality is consistent with universal laws. Where the
MCCOY,What do you mean unreal? I examined Chekov. He's dead.
SPOCK,But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot
KIRK,Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him.
SPOCK,He may indeed be dead. We do not know.
KIRK,But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation. If we
SPOCK,"Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot"
KIRK,"We must all be as certain as you are, Mister Spock, to save our"
SPOCK,Precisely.
MCCOY,But that's not possible. There'd always be some doubt.
SPOCK,The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you.
MCCOY,"We're just human beings, Spock. We don't have that clockwork"
KIRK,"We must. Spock, a Vulcan mind meld."
SPOCK,"Very well, sir. Engineer?"
SPOCK,Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts.
SPOCK, The bullets are unreal. Without body. They are
MCCOY,They do not exist.
SPOCK,Captain.
WYATT,Draw.
CHEKOV,"Captain, I don't understand."
MCCOY,Neither do I. He's in perfect health.
CHEKOV,What happened? Where have I been?
KIRK,"Right here, it seems."
CHEKOV,But that girl. She was so beautiful. So real.
KIRK,Do you remember anything else?
CHEKOV,No.
KIRK,Good. Perhaps that explains why he's here. Nothing was real to
SPOCK,"Captain, the Melkotian object."
KIRK,Sensor readings.
SPOCK,The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable
KIRK,"Lieutenant, sound Red Alert. Mister Chekov, deflector shields on"
SPOCK,"Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, Captain."
KIRK,"Phaser guns, stand by to fire."
CHEKOV,"It's, it's gone, sir."
KIRK,"Damage report, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"No damage, sir. All decks report fully operational."
KIRK,It is. We fight only when there's no choice. We prefer the ways
KIRK,"Excellent. Lieutenant, cancel Red Alert. Mister Chekov, resume"
CHEKOV,"Warp factor two, sir."
SPOCK,Captain. May I ask a question? You needn't answer if it seems
KIRK,"I'm sure I'll be able to give you an answer, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you?"
MCCOY,"But he didn't kill, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"But he wanted to, Doctor."
KIRK,"Is that the way it seemed to you, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, you're absolutely right. That's exactly the way it"
SPOCK,"Mankind, ready to kill."
KIRK,That's the way it was in 1881.
SPOCK,I wonder how humanity managed to survive.
KIRK,We overcame our instinct for violence.
UnknownOriginal Airdate,"1 Nov, 1968"
KIRK,"Report, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,Full scan. Results negative. Radiation level normal. Atmosphere
KIRK,"Life readings, Doctor McCoy?"
MCCOY,Nothing. They said they were being attacked by an unidentified
CHEKOV,Which we were unable to detect upon approach.
KIRK,"An entire human colony, a whole settlement. One hundred men,"
SPOCK,"Sensors have picked up a Klingon ship,"
KIRK,Total reply if attacked. So that's the
SULU,Trouble aboard the Klingon ship. Evidence of
SPOCK,And we never fired upon her.
KIRK,Maintain Red Alert.
KANG,"You attacked my ship! Four hundred of my crew dead. Kirk, my ship"
KANG,"For three years, the Federation and the Klingon Empire have been"
KIRK,"We took no action against your ship, Kang."
KANG,"Were the screams of my crew imaginary? What were your orders,"
KIRK,There was a Federation colony on this planet. It was destroyed.
KANG,"By what? No bodies, no ruins. A colony of the invisible?"
KIRK,"Yes, a test of a new Klingon weapon, leaving no traces."
KANG,We have wondered when you would begin. You lured my ship into
KIRK,You received a distress call? We received a distress call.
KANG,I don't propose to spend the rest of my life on this ball of dust
KIRK,Go to the devil.
KANG,"We have no devil, Kirk. But we understand the habits of yours. I"
CHEKOV,Cossacks! Filthy Klingon murderers! You killed my brother
KANG,And you volunteer to join him. That is loyalty.
KIRK,Chekov! Stop the torture!
MCCOY,"Jim, you can't hand over the Enterprise."
KIRK,Help Chekov.
KANG,"Don't plan any tricks, Kirk. I will kill one hundred hostages at"
KIRK,"I'll beam you aboard the Enterprise. Once there, no tricks."
CHEKOV,"Captain, you can't. Don't let these animals have the ship."
MCCOY,Move aside. 
KANG,Animals? Your captain crawls like one. A Klingon would never have
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Spock.
KIRK,"Mister Spock, we have guests. Adjust transporter to wide field."
SPOCK,"Understood, Captain. Transporter room."
KIRK,"Full security, Johnson, on the double."
KIRK,"Good work, Spock."
MCCOY,What happened?
SPOCK,"Our landing party is intact, Doctor."
SCOTT,"All others suspended in transit. Who are the guests, by the way?"
KIRK,Klingons.
SCOTT,"Well, they're right in here."
KIRK,Johnson?
JOHNSON,"Security on the way, sir."
CHEKOV,"Captain, leave them where they are. Non-existence. That's so"
KIRK,Bring them in.
JOHNSON,Move 'em out. Move!
KANG,Liar!
KIRK,I said no tricks after we reach the ship. You're a prisoner of
KANG,There are still survivors aboard my ship.
SCOTT,"Captain, we've not been able to get through to Starfleet"
KIRK,Prepare to destruct.
KANG,Completing the job you started?
KIRK,You wouldn't be standing here if I had.
SPOCK,"First group from the Klingon vessel, Captain."
KANG,"My wife, Mara, and my science officer."
MARA,"Kang, what has happened?"
KANG,More Federation treachery. We are prisoners.
MARA,"What will they do to us? I've heard of their atrocities, their"
KIRK,Apparently you have a few things to learn about us. Detain them
KANG,So I have seen.
KIRK,Secure from Red Alert.
KIRK,But maintain general quarters. Scan this sector for other ships.
CHEKOV,We know what happened. That distress call.
SPOCK,At the moment we received the distress signal from the colony on
CHEKOV,Lies. They want to start a war by
MCCOY,Chekov may be right. The Klingons claim to have honoured the
KIRK,No proof that Klingons committed it.
MCCOY,What proof do we need? We know what a Klingon is.
SPOCK,Our log tapes will indicate our innocence in the present
KIRK,"Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that they will be believed."
KIRK,Report.
UHURA,"Still no contact with Starfleet Command, sir. Outside"
KIRK,Keep trying. We've got a diplomatic tiger by the tail.
KIRK,"Very good, Scotty. Mister Sulu?"
SULU,"Forward phasers locked and ready to fire, sir."
KIRK,Fire phasers.
SPOCK,"Sensor sweeps reveal no other ships within range, Captain."
KIRK,Lieutenant Uhura?
UHURA,"No contact with Starfleet as yet, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, change course to seventeen mark four, warp factor"
SULU,"Warp factor three, sir."
KANG,"When I take this ship, I'll have Kirk's head"
MARA,They will kill us before we can act.
KANG,"No, they wish to question us, learn our strength, our plans. They"
MARA,We are forty against four hundred.

SCOTT,The controls have gone crazy. Something's

SCOTT,"They've gone to warp nine, by themselves!"
KIRK,New course?
SULU,Nine oh two mark five.
KIRK,That'll take us out of the galaxy.

CHEKOV,"Sir, let me go too. I've got a personal score to settle with"
KIRK,This is no time for a vendetta. Maintain your post.
CHEKOV,Captain!
KIRK,"Chekov, maintain your post!"
CHEKOV,"Don't try to stop me, Captain. I saw what they left of Piotre,"
SULU,What's Chekov's grudge against the Klingons? Who's Piotre?
KIRK,"His only brother, killed in a Klingon raid."
SULU,His brother? He never had a brother. He's an only child.
KIRK,"Sulu, get down to Engineering."
SULU,"Aye, sir."

SPOCK,I shall attempt a compensatory reading of Klingon units.

KIRK,Gentlemen!  Spock!
SPOCK,Fascinating. The result of stress?
KIRK,We've been under stress before. It's never set us at each other's
SCOTT,But this is war.
KIRK,There isn't any war! Or is there?
SCOTT,Have we forgotten how to defend ourselves?
KIRK,Scotty. What's happening to us? We've been trained to think in

KIRK,We're getting something.
SULU,"Aye, Captain. Power and life-support"
SCOTT,"But, Captain, I didn't do it. Everything just came on by itself."
MARA,Their life-support systems have resumed.
SPOCK,Sensors may be operating.
KIRK,Start scanning. Let's find that alien.
MARA,Holding steady.
KANG,Cause them to be unsteady.
MARA,They appear to be controlled from another location. Also unable
KANG,One of Kirk's tricks. Could he bypass this circuit? What power is
MARA,Number six deck.  Come.
SPOCK,"Alien detected in the engineering section,"
KIRK,Let's go.
CHEKOV,"You don't die yet. You're not human, but you're very beautiful."
KIRK,Chekov!
SPOCK,"Jim, he's not responsible."
KIRK,What have I done?  There's an alien entity aboard the
KIRK,"Chekov. Chekov.  Is this what's in store for us,"
MCCOY,Brain waves show almost paranoid mania. What happened?
KIRK,He lost control. So did I. We're becoming animal warriors. Let's
MCCOY,Orderly. Jim. Johnson's heart wound is almost healed. Same with
SPOCK,It would appear that the entity wants us alive.
KIRK,"Why? So we can fight, and fight, and keep coming back for more"
SPOCK,Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat capabilities
MCCOY,"Gentlemen, if we are pawns, you're looking at one who is"
SPOCK,"I understand, Doctor. I, too, felt a brief surge of racial"
KIRK,Let's find the alien.  You come with us. Maybe we can
KIRK,What is it?
SPOCK,Totally unfamiliar.
KIRK,What do you want? What are you doing here?
JOHNSON,"Reporting for duty, sir."
KIRK,Duty? Did McCoy release you from Sickbay?
JOHNSON,I released myself.
KIRK,Then get back to Sickbay!
JOHNSON,"Not on your life, sir. I'm fit and ready for action. The"
KIRK,I order you
JOHNSON,I've got my orders. I'm obeying orders! Kill the Klingons!
KIRK,Johnson!
SPOCK,"Fascinating. During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his"
KIRK,It subsists on the emotions of others.
SPOCK,This one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of
KIRK,It exists on the hate of others.
SPOCK,"To put it simply. And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this"
KIRK,"And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain"
SPOCK,Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated. The
KIRK,"Or we're a doomed ship, travelling forever between galaxies,"
MARA,"Commander, it's a trick!"
KIRK,Kang.  He won't answer.
SPOCK,"The alien is affecting his mind, Captain. Soon, it will become"
SCOTT,The ship's dilithium crystals are
KIRK,Time factor?
KIRK,"Well, do whatever you can. Kirk out."
KIRK,"And so we drift in space, with only hatred and bloodshed aboard."
SCOTT,"There's no change, Captain. The dilithium"
SPOCK,There's nothing we can do about it.
KIRK,"If I could talk to Kang, somehow cut through the Klingon lines,"
SPOCK,"We have nine minutes, fifty three seconds to power zero. SPOCK:"
SCOTT,Aye. Now that's something the Klingons would understand.
KIRK,"Kang! Kang, this is Captain Kirk."
KIRK,She has five seconds to live. Reply.
KANG,"She is a victim of war, Captain."
KIRK,He called my bluff.
MARA,You're not going
KIRK,The Federation doesn't kill or mistreat its prisoners. You've
SPOCK,"Eight minutes, forty two seconds."
MARA,So this was no trick?
SCOTT,"It's the alien that's done this. We're in its power, our people"
KIRK,We only wanted to stop the fighting to save us all.
MARA,"We have always fought. We must. We are hunters, Captain, tracking"
KIRK,There's another way to survive. Mutual trust and help.
MARA,I will help you now.
KIRK,How?
MARA,I will take you to Kang. I will add my voice to yours.
SCOTT,"I wouldn't trust her, Captain."
KIRK,"We can't get through the Klingon defences in time, unless. Spock."
SPOCK,It has rarely been done because of the danger involved. Pinpoint
SCOTT,"Even if it could work, she may be leading you into a trap."
KIRK,We're all in a trap. This is the only way out.
SCOTT,We'll go with you.
KIRK,No. That'd start the final battle. I believe her. Prepare the
SCOTT,"But she can't guarantee that Kang will stop to listen, right,"
SPOCK,No one can guarantee the actions of another.
SPOCK,"When transporter is energised, you will have"
KIRK,"I hope your computations are correct, Mister"
KANG,"Mara, you're alive, and you bring us a prize."
MARA,"Kang, wait. He's come alone, unarmed. He must talk to you."
KANG,"Brave captain, what about?"
MARA,No! Listen to him. We are all in danger.
KIRK,"Mara. Before you start killing, give me one minute."
MARA,"Kang, don't!"
KANG,"What have they done to you, Mara? Are you out of your mind? What"
MARA,They didn't harm me. Listen to him.
KANG,"With your death, we win."
KIRK,Nobody wins. Have any more of your men died? We can't be killed.
KANG,No doubt you will reassemble after I have hacked you to bits!
MARA,You fool.
KIRK,"Look! Look, Kang. For the rest of our lives. A thousand"
KIRK,All right. All right. In the heart. In the head. I won't stay
MCCOY,Let's jump him.
SPOCK,"Those who hate and fight must stop themselves, Doctor."
MARA,"Kang, I am your wife. I'm a Klingon. Would I lie for them? Listen"
KIRK,"Be a pawn, be a toy, be a good soldier that never questions"
KANG,Klingons kill for their own purposes.
SPOCK,"All fighting must end, Captain, to weaken the alien before our"
KIRK,Lieutenant Uhura.
KIRK,Put me on ship-wide intercom.
KIRK,Kang.
KIRK,This is Captain Kirk. A truce is ordered. The fighting is over.
KANG,This is Kang. Cease hostilities. Disarm.
SPOCK,"The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain."
KIRK,Get off my ship. You're a dead duck here. You're powerless. We
MCCOY,"Yeah, out already."
KANG,"Out! We need no urging to hate humans. But for the present, only"
Original Airdate,"8 Nov, 1968"
SPOCK,"Do we have maximum magnification, Lieutenant?"
SULU,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Missile spread, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Very archaic type, Captain. Sub light speed."
SCOTT,"Aye, and chemically fuelled to boot, sir."
KIRK,"Anything on communications, Lieutenant Uhura?"
UHURA,"No, sir. All bands clear."
KIRK,"Course of the missile, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"It would appear that the Enterprise is the target, Captain."
KIRK,"Prepare phaser banks one and two, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, get a fix on the missile's point of origin."
CHEKOV,"Aye, Captain."
SULU,Phasers one and two locked in and ready.
KIRK,"Fire phasers.  Mister Chekov, alter"
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Warp factor three, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Warp factor three, sir."

MCCOY,You're excused. You may return to your quarters.
CHAPEL,"No, I'm sorry, Doctor. I've called the Captain and I'll wait"
KIRK,What's the emergency?
MCCOY,"I said you were excused, Nurse. Please, Christine. I promise you"
KIRK,That was quite a scene.
MCCOY,I've just completed the standard physical examinations for the
KIRK,Excellent. What's the emergency?
MCCOY,"The crew is fit. I found nothing unusual, with one exception."
KIRK,Serious?
MCCOY,Terminal.
KIRK,What is it?
MCCOY,Xenopolycythemia. It has no cure.
KIRK,Who?
MCCOY,He has one year to live.
KIRK,Who is it?
MCCOY,The ship's Chief Medical Officer.
KIRK,You.
MCCOY,"I'll be most effective on the job in the time left, if you'll"
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain?"
KIRK,Confirm Chekov's co-ordinates for the missile's point of origin.
SPOCK,"Correct, Captain. We are approaching those co-ordinates."
KIRK,That object on the screen?
SPOCK,"An asteroid, two hundred miles in diameter."
KIRK,Could the enemy vessel be hiding behind the asteroid?
SPOCK,"Negative, Captain. We've had that area on scanners constantly."
KIRK,Then the asteroid is the missile's point of origin.
SPOCK,"Correct, Captain."
KIRK,"Full sensor probe, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Typical asteroid chemically, but it is not orbiting. It is"
KIRK,How could that be? Unless it's powered. A spaceship?
SPOCK,"It is under power, Captain. And correcting for all gravitational"
KIRK,Source of power?
SPOCK,Atomic. Very archaic. Leaving a trail of debris and hard

CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,"Asteroid has an outer shell, which is hollow. It surrounds an"
SCOTT,Then it must be on automatic controls.
SPOCK,"Then the passengers, or builders, are dead."
CHEKOV,"Course of asteroid, I mean spaceship two four one mark one"
SPOCK,Interesting.
KIRK,Yes?
SPOCK,The course Ensign Chekov just gave for the asteroid would put it

SCOTT,"Aye, sir."
CHAPEL,"A lot can happen in a year. Please, give"
KIRK,"Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and I will handle this."
MCCOY,"Without me, Jim? You'd never find your way back."
KIRK,"Well, I think it would be wiser if"
MCCOY,"I'd like to go. I'm fine, Captain."
KIRK,"All right, Doctor. If that's what you want."
MCCOY,You'd swear you were on the surface of a planet.
SPOCK,One fails to see the logic in making a ship look like a planet.
KIRK,Wouldn't know this was a spaceship. Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Transported without incident. Kirk out.
KIRK,No apparent opening.
MCCOY,"You found no intelligent life forms, Mister Spock, but surely"
SPOCK,"The asteroid ship is over ten thousand years old, Doctor. Still"
NATIRA,These are weapons?
KIRK,"Of a sort. Weapons, communication devices. Let me go to my"
KIRK,You all right?
MCCOY,I think so.
NATIRA,"I am Natira, the high priestess of the people. Welcome to the"
KIRK,I can't say I think much of your welcome.
NATIRA,Take them.
NATIRA,You will kneel.
MCCOY,She called this the world. These people don't know they're on a

KIRK,We've come in friendship.
ORACLE,Then learn what it means to be our enemy before you learn what
KIRK,Spock.  Doctor McCoy. Bones. Bones?
SPOCK,The doctor must have received an excessively large electrical
KIRK,"No, that's not it."
SPOCK,"Nothing else could've caused this, Captain. At least nothing"
KIRK,"You're right, Spock. The shock was serious because of McCoy's"
SPOCK,May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor?
KIRK,"I don't think he would've told you himself, but I think you"
SPOCK,"Yes. I know of it, Captain."
KIRK,Then you know that nothing can be done.
KIRK,"Bones, how is it?"
MCCOY,"I'm all right. Are you all right, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Very well, Doctor. The Captain and I seem to have suffered no"
MCCOY,"Oh, that Oracle really got to me. I must be especially"
KIRK,Spock knows.
MCCOY,"Well, we'd better get to the control room."
KIRK,Are you in any condition to get up?
MCCOY,"Don't worry. I can make it, Jim."
SPOCK,"Captain, informing these people they're on a ship may be in"
KIRK,"No. The people of Yonada may be changed by the knowledge, but"
SPOCK,"Logical, Captain."
KIRK,And the three billion on Daran Five.
SPOCK,"Also logical, Captain."
MCCOY,"Gentlemen, I believe we have a visitor."
MAN,For strength. Many of us have felt the power of our Oracle. This
MCCOY,It tastes like an ancient herb derivative.
MAN,You are not of Yonada.
KIRK,"No, we're from outside your world."
MAN,Where is outside?
KIRK,"Up there. Outside, up there, everywhere."
MAN,"So they say, also.  Many years ago I climbed"
KIRK,Why is it forbidden?
MAN,I am not sure.  But things are not as they teach us. For
KIRK,"What is it, Bones?"
MCCOY,There's something under the skin.  He's
KIRK,"For the world is hollow, and I have touched the sky."
SPOCK,He said it was forbidden to climb the mountains.
KIRK,"Yes, of course it is, because if you did you'd touch the sky and"
NATIRA,What happened?
KIRK,We don't know. He just suddenly screamed in pain and died.
NATIRA, Fetch the guard.  Forgive him for
NATIRA,You do not seem well. It is distressing to me.
MCCOY,"Oh, no. I'm quite all right, thank you."
NATIRA,It is the will of the Oracle that you now be treated as
KIRK,You seem to be the special favourite.
SPOCK,"Indeed, Doctor. The young lady did show a marked preference for"
MCCOY,"Well, now. Nobody can blame her for that, can they?"
KIRK,"Personally, I find the lady's taste questionable, but she"
NATIRA,It is time to refresh yourselves.
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock. To our good friends of Yonada."
SPOCK,We are very interested in your world.
NATIRA,That pleases us.
KIRK,Good. Then you wouldn't mind if we looked around?
NATIRA,Not at all. The people know of you now.  Are you well
MCCOY,Perhaps not.
NATIRA,Then why not remain here? Rest. We will talk.
MCCOY,You are very kind.
NATIRA,You are free to go about and meet our people.
KIRK,Thank you. And thank you for taking care of Doctor McCoy.
NATIRA,Not at all. We shall make him well.
KIRK,Mister Spock.
MCCOY,"No, thank you."
NATIRA,Leave us.
MCCOY,I'm curious. How did the Oracle punish the old man?
NATIRA,I cannot tell you now.
MCCOY,"There is some way the Oracle knows what you say, isn't there?"
NATIRA,"What we say, what we think. The Oracle knows the minds and the"
MCCOY,It's all right. I suppose we had to learn the power of the

MCCOY,Honesty is usually wise.
NATIRA,Is there a woman for you?
MCCOY,"No, there isn't."
NATIRA,Does McCoy find me attractive?
MCCOY,"Oh, yes. Yes, I do."
NATIRA,"I hope you men of space, of other worlds, hold truth as dear as"
MCCOY,We do.
NATIRA,I wish you to stay here on Yonada as my mate.
MCCOY,But we're strangers to each other.
NATIRA,But is not that the nature of men and women? That the pleasure
MCCOY,Yes.
NATIRA,"Let the thought rest in your heart, McCoy."
SPOCK,"Incredible as it may seem, these people have"
KIRK,I wonder how many generations have lived out their lives and been
NATIRA,"The people, in the fullness of time, will"
MCCOY,How long will it take you to reach this new world?
NATIRA,Soon. The Oracle will only say soon.
MCCOY,"If you only knew how I needed some kind of future, Natira."
NATIRA,You have lived a lonely life?
MCCOY,"Yes, very lonely."
NATIRA,"No more, McCoy. There will be no more loneliness for you."
MCCOY,There's something I need to tell you.
NATIRA,There is nothing you need to say.
MCCOY,But there is.
NATIRA,"Then tell me, if the telling is such a need."
MCCOY,I have an illness for which there is no cure. I have one year to

SPOCK,I believe that I can.  The

SPOCK,"Yes. Towards the end, the Fabrini people lived underground, as"
KIRK,Some of them must have been put aboard this ship and sent to

KIRK,I think you're right. Continue investigating. The clue to the
SPOCK,Nothing here which would indicate this is anything but a planet.
KIRK,This plaque is a representation of a star and its solar system.
SPOCK,"Eight planets, Captain. That is the number in the Fabrina solar"
KIRK,Then there's no doubt these people are the descendants of the
SPOCK,And no doubt they've been in flight on this asteroid ship for

NATIRA,"It is I, Natira."
ORACLE,"Yes, Natira."
NATIRA,It is written only the high priestess of the people may select
ORACLE,It is so written.

ORACLE,Does he agree to this?
NATIRA,I have asked him. He has not yet given me his answer.
ORACLE,"He must become one of the people, worship the creators, and"
NATIRA,He will be told what must be done.
ORACLE,"If he agrees to all things, it is permitted. Teach him our laws"
NATIRA,"It will be done, o most wise."
ORACLE,Who are the intruders?
NATIRA,"Two of the strangers, Kirk and Spock."
ORACLE,McCoy is not with them?
NATIRA,No.
ORACLE,Kirk and Spock have committed sacrilege. You know what must be

MCCOY,What are you going to do to my friends?
NATIRA,They entered the Oracle room.
MCCOY,And the punishment is death?
NATIRA,"Yes. I can make no other decision. We gave them our trust, they"
MCCOY,"They acted out of ignorance, Natira."
NATIRA,They said they came in friendship.
MCCOY,Please let them return to the ship.
NATIRA,I cannot.
MCCOY,"For me? I've made my decision. I'm staying here, on Yonada."
NATIRA,Yes. So be it. This I will do for McCoy. For our happiness and
KIRK,You're returning with us?
MCCOY,"No, I'm not."
KIRK,"Bones, this isn't a planet. It's a space ship on a collision"
MCCOY,"I'm on a kind of a collision course myself, Jim."
KIRK,"Doctor McCoy, I order you to return with us."
MCCOY,And I refuse.
KIRK,"Bones, if we can't correct the course of this ship, we'll have to"
MCCOY,"I intend to stay on this ship, with these people, whatever"
SPOCK,"Your decision is most illogical, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Is it, Mister Spock? Is it really? Natira's asked me to stay,"
KIRK,As her husband?
MCCOY,"Yes. Is that too much to ask, Jim?"
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,We're beaming over. Lock in on our signal.
KIRK,And transport Mister Spock and myself immediately.
KIRK,"He's staying, Scotty. Kirk out."
ORACLE,"To become one of the people of Yonada, the Instrument of"

MCCOY,Let it be done.
NATIRA,You are now one with my people.  May I

NATIRA,One heart.
MCCOY,One life.
NATIRA,"It is done, O most wise. Our living link with the creators."
ORACLE,"Teach him, then, what he must know as one of the people."
NATIRA,"This is the Book of the People, to be opened and read when we"
MCCOY,Do the people know the contents of their book?
NATIRA,"Only that it tells of our world here and why soon, one day, we"
MCCOY,Has the reason that the people must leave here been revealed to
NATIRA,"No, it has not."
MCCOY,Don't you long to know its secrets?
NATIRA,No. It is enough for me to know that we shall understand all
KIRK,"That is the problem, sir."
SPOCK,I believe it's time to move on.
KIRK,Yes. Those are the orders.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,Put him on.
KIRK,"Yes, Bones."
KIRK,You've located the controls?
MCCOY,"No, but I've seen the book that contains all"
MCCOY,"If you can get to it, Spock"
KIRK,Where is it?
KIRK,"Bones, are you all right?"
NATIRA,You are killers of your friend. I will have you put to death.
KIRK,Help him.
NATIRA,"Until you are dead, he will think of you and disobey! I will"
KIRK,"Spock, take care of McCoy."
NATIRA, He is not part of our people. You've released him
KIRK,We have freed him from the cruelty of your Oracle.
NATIRA,McCoy.
KIRK,Bones. Bones. You said something about a book. Where is it?
NATIRA,They must not know.
MCCOY,The Oracle room.
NATIRA,You will never see the book. It is sacrilege! Guards! Guards!
KIRK,Now listen to me. You must listen to what I have to say. Give me
NATIRA,What do you wish to say?
KIRK,You must believe that what I'm about to tell you is the truth.
NATIRA,"Your truth, of your world."
KIRK,"Yes, my world and your world of Yonada."
NATIRA,You don't obey the law of the creators. How can you understand
KIRK,"I understand. I understand, Natira. Ten thousand years ago, a sun"
NATIRA,That is a world of which Yonada is a part.
KIRK,"No. It is the world of your ancestors, your creators. It no"
NATIRA,You are mad.
KIRK,"No, I'm not. Now listen to me! Hear me out. When your ancestors"
NATIRA,You wish me to believe that Yonada is a ship?
KIRK,Yes.
NATIRA,But we have a sun. It did not die. At night I see the stars.
KIRK,No. You are living inside a hollow ball. Your ancestors created

KIRK,Do you think she understood me?
SPOCK,She evidently understood something. There are no guards to

NATIRA,Yes. I have listened.
ORACLE,That was the first transgression. You felt the pain of warning?
NATIRA,"Yes, I did."
ORACLE,Why did you listen further?
NATIRA,They said they spoke the truth.
ORACLE,Their truth.
NATIRA,Is truth not truth for all?
ORACLE,The truth of Yonada is your truth. There can be no other for
NATIRA,I must know the truth of the world!
NATIRA,Your friends have told me of your world.
MCCOY,They spoke the truth.
NATIRA,I believe you. I believe. The creators kept us in darkness.
KIRK,Is she all right?
MCCOY,She will be. I'll stay here with her. The book is in the
ORACLE,It is sacrilege to the temple.
KIRK,We do this for the survival of the people of Yonada.
ORACLE,You are not believers. You are forbidden to gaze at the book.
KIRK,We mean no desecration to the faith of Yonada. We must consult
ORACLE,It is blasphemy. You are forbidden. The punishment is death.

MCCOY,Yes.
NATIRA,And will they send this this ship again to the land the

NATIRA,That is good.
KIRK,Active and functional. Not too different from

KIRK,Enough to turn it off course?
SPOCK,"Yes. Let me check that engine. A very simple problem, easy to"
MCCOY,Then come.
NATIRA,No.
MCCOY,Don't be afraid.
NATIRA,I do not fear the punishment of disobedience.
We must hurry to join NATIRA,"No, I cannot go with you. It is not fear. I understand the"
MCCOY,"You intend to stay here, on Yonada?"
NATIRA,"I shall stay willingly, and because that is what I must do."
MCCOY,Then I won't leave you.

KIRK,You mean what happened to the Defiant might be happening to the
SPOCK,Affirmative.
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott.
KIRK,"Mister Scott, stand by to beam us back."
SCOTT,"I can't, sir. At least, not all at once."
KIRK,Why not? What's happened?
SCOTT,Everything. That ship you're in is fading
KIRK,"Chekov, McCoy, prepare for transportation. You, too, Spock."
SPOCK,"Request permission to remain, Captain. I could be completing the"
KIRK,Request denied.
SPOCK,"Captain, there is a chance"
KIRK,"I know what the chances are. Mister Spock, don't argue. Get back"
SCOTT,Aye.
SPOCK,Energise.
CHEKOV,It's gone. The Defiant just vanished.
SCOTT,Anything?
SPOCK,Negative.
SCOTT,That's it. I've done all I can. There's nothing out there to

SPOCK,Compute the next period of spatial interphase.
COMPUTER,Next interphase two hours twelve minutes.
SCOTT,Two hours and twelve minutes? That power leak has unbalanced the

CHEKOV,I don't understand what's so special about this region of

CHEKOV,And die like him?
SPOCK,Chekov! Chekov!

UHURA,"Aye, sir."
MCCOY,"What happened, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,I was attempting to explain to Mister Chekov the nature of our
MCCOY,Did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before
SULU,I think he had several spasms of pain.
MCCOY,Did he seem to be getting hysterical?
UHURA,"Doctor, he seemed more angry than frightened."
SCOTT,He had no cause to be angry.
MCCOY,Take Mister Chekov to Sickbay. Put him under restraint.
SPOCK,Lieutenant Uhura is correct. There was murderous fury in Chekov.
MCCOY,That's what I was afraid of. Whatever it was that drove the crew
SPOCK,Is there anything you need to isolate the cause?
MCCOY,"Time. By the way, Mister Spock, I think it might be a wise"
SPOCK,"If we are to recover the Captain, we must not move."
MCCOY,How long will that take?
SPOCK,Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made.
MCCOY,"Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive?"
SPOCK,The Captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant

UHURA,Mister Spock? I'm receiving a visual signal.

SPOCK,"Lieutenant Sulu, evaluation."
SULU,Sensor readings are not corresponding to those we received the
SPOCK,It's possible the Tholian entry into the area has disturbed the
SPOCK,Spock here.
MCCOY,Has the Captain been beamed aboard yet?
MCCOY,When is that interphase going to happen?
SPOCK,"Theoretically it already has happened,"
MCCOY,I thought you had the thing timed out.
SPOCK,"I did, Doctor. The space was disturbed by"

SULU,"Phasers locked in, sir."
UHURA,"There's no response on any frequency, sir."
MCCOY,"What's the use of this battle, Spock? You've lost Jim. Take this"
SPOCK,"Ready, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,"Ready, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Fire.
SULU,"A hit, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Engineering, status report. Mister Scott?"
SCOTT,I can't do a thing with the Enterprise now.
SPOCK,Can you estimate minimum time required for repair?
SCOTT,I don't even know if she can be repaired.
MCCOY,"Are you satisfied? Spock, why did you do it?"
SPOCK,The decision to fight was logical. Lack of time prevented any
MCCOY,You should've known what could've happened and done everything
SPOCK,"Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons."
SULU,"Mister Spock, something has just entered sensor range. It's"
SPOCK,Fascinating.
SULU,"Shall I lock in remaining phaser power, sir?"
SPOCK,"Negative. Lieutenant Uhura, can you open a channel to the"
UHURA,They're refusing reception. I can't

SULU,"Just beyond phaser range, sir."
UHURA,What is that?
SPOCK,"Mister Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments. Tie in"
SULU,"Yes, sir."
SPOCK,There's no analogy to this structure in Federation technology.
SPOCK,"Doctor, your last report on an antidote on the effects of this"

CHAPEL,"Are we any closer, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"No, except I'm positive that it's a theragen derivative that's"
UHURA,"Mister Spock didn't believe me either, did he, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"Well, nobody saw him but you, Uhura."
UHURA,"Then I didn't really see him, did I?"
MCCOY,I don't think so.
UHURA,"Will I become like Chekov, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"No, no. We're working hard. We'll find an antidote."

SCOTT,"Mister Spock, look!"
SPOCK,Captain? Captain? Captain.
UHURA,"Am I all right, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"Yes, Uhura, you're fine."
UHURA,Then what I saw
MCCOY,It was real.
UHURA,Captain Kirk's alive?
MCCOY,We all saw him. The Captain's still alive.
MCCOY,McCoy here.
CHAPEL,"Results of the last theragen test are ready for you, Doctor."
MCCOY,I'll be right there.
SCOTT,Then your fears about that phaser were
SPOCK,Exactly. But the Captain remained. Only the overlap time
SPOCK,Can you be ready?

MCCOY,"Yes, and I've ordered it orally or intravenously for everyone"
SPOCK,Ensign Chekov was affected so early. Has he responded to it?
MCCOY,He's his smiling self again. I've discharged him from Sickbay.
SCOTT,What is it?
MCCOY,It's a diluted theragen derivative.
SPOCK,Theragen? A nerve gas used by the Klingons.
SCOTT,"Aye. And deadly, too. What are you thinking of, Doc? Are you"

CHEKOV,We're being pulled out of here.
SPOCK,Try to maintain position Mister Sulu.
SULU,"I can't, sir."
SPOCK,"Engineering, bring ship's power up to full capability."

CHEKOV,"Captain, we have destroyed the Tholians' web."

MCCOY,"He means when humans become involved with Vulcans, Jim."
KIRK,"Ah, yes. I understand. Well, I hope my last orders were helpful"
SPOCK,"Orders, Captain?"
MCCOY,"What orders are you referring to, Jim?"
KIRK,My last orders. The last orders that I left for both of you. The

PARMEN,Where?

PHILANA,"Alexander, you talk too much."
PARMEN,"What is it? What is your prognosis, Doctor?"

PHILANA,Two and a half. Ever since our arrival here on Platonius.

PHILANA,Brain waves.

PHILANA,"No, not if they're embedded in the unconscious."
MCCOY,What about medicine? Why no doctors?
PHILANA,We haven't had any pressing need for the medical arts. You

PHILANA,"That old? I stopped aging at thirty. Well, anyway, you're off"

KIRK,I guess we weren't sufficiently entertaining.
CHAPEL,Are we ever glad to see you.
UHURA,We were forced in the transporter and beamed down. It was like

DIONIYDE,"Oh, how faithless and fickle."
ERACLITUS,Make up your minds.
CHAPEL,I'm so ashamed. Please make them stop.
SPOCK,We have tried.
CHAPEL,"Please, please make them stop."
SPOCK,I haven't the power. I'm deeply sorry. We've failed you.
CHAPEL,For so long I've wanted to be close to you. Now all I want to

UHURA," I'm so frightened, Captain. I'm so very"
KIRK,That's the way they want you to feel. It makes them think that

KIRK,Try not to think of them. Try.
UHURA,I'm thinking. I'm thinking of all the times on the Enterprise

PARMEN,"You are so impatient, my wife. Observe the doctor and learn."
KIRK,"You're half dead, all of you! You've been dead for centuries. We"
MCCOY,"Stop it, Parmen! Stop it! I'll do whatever you want me to do."
PHILANA,Parmen.
PARMEN,"Alexander again. He likes to play with knives. Very well, we"
PARMEN,Who did that?
KIRK, I did.
ERACLITUS,Impossible!
SPOCK,Quite possible and logical.
DIONIYDE,What is this?
PHILANA,What's going on?
KIRK,"Platonians, listen to me. The next one of you that tries any"

MCCOY,No. There's no mention of it.

MCCOY,What do you mean?
KIRK,"I mean that twice before something touched me, and there was"

SPOCK,Purpose of the invasion?

SPOCK,Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance?
COMPUTER,Data insufficient.
SPOCK,Are we at present capable of resisting?
COMPUTER,Negative.
SPOCK,Your recommendation?

DEELA,Yes. You beamed me aboard yourself when you came up. A

DEELA,Nothing.
KIRK,Nothing? Mister Spock? Scotty. This is nothing?
DEELA,There's really nothing wrong with them. They are just as they

DEELA,"They cannot hear you, Captain. To their ears, you sound like an"
KIRK,What have you done?
DEELA,Changed you. So you are like me now. Your crew cannot see you or
KIRK,Why?
DEELA,Because I like you. Didn't you guess? Or are you so accustomed
KIRK,Deela. Is this why you sabotaged my ship?
DEELA,"Oh, but it has not been sabotaged. We we had to make some"
KIRK,You said we?
DEELA,Yes. Of course. My chief scientist and his crew. I am their

DEELA,"Oh, in a few of their moments, they will realise that you've"
KIRK," This won't kill you, but the stun effect is"

COMPTON,"Captain Kirk, you've made it."
KIRK,"Compton, did they accelerate you?"
COMPTON,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,They hooked something into the life support system. They're in

KIRK,By whose order?
COMPTON,"The commander, sir. You'll have to step back, please."
KIRK,"I'm your commander, Compton. I order you to let me in."
COMPTON,"I'm sorry, sir. You are no longer."

COMPTON,"At first I refused, but then after a while I found I couldn't"
KIRK,"All right, Compton."
RAEL,Stun.
RAEL,You were ordered to stop him. Why did you disobey?
COMPTON,I tried to stop him. You hurt him.
RAEL,He was violent. He had to be subdued.
COMPTON,He was my captain.
EKOR,Cell damage.
RAEL, Another will be secured for you.
SPOCK,I'm getting a trace reading similar to that
SULU,Yes.
SPOCK,Did anyone else?
SCOTT,I had some.
SPOCK,May I?
SCOTT,"Was it the coffee? Are we going to go too, just like the"
SPOCK,I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed.
SCOTT,By that time it'll be too late.
SPOCK,"I suggest that we recall the captain's words, Make them take the"

RAEL,It may be.
DEELA,I hope so. They all go so soon. I want to keep this one a long

DEELA,Oh? I don't think so.
RAEL,You cannot allow yourself to feel an attachment to such.
DEELA,"I can allow myself anything I want. Oh, Rael, don't be like"
RAEL,I do my duty.
DEELA,So do I. And sometimes I allow myself to enjoy it.
DEELA,Hello.
KIRK,What is that device doing on my ship?
RAEL,Deela will explain it.
DEELA,"I will tell you anything you want to know, and you'll approve of"
KIRK,Approve of it? We're your prisoners.
DEELA,Hardly. You're free to go anywhere you want to.
RAEL,"Go ahead, Captain. It is not yet completely linked to your"

RAEL,"In your struggle with Compton, some of his cells were damaged."
KIRK,He was so young.
RAEL,Was.
KIRK,This is what you have planned for us?
DEELA,"We all die, even on Scalos."
DEELA,"Why did you lie to him? He did not damage that one, you did."
RAEL,Perhaps he will be less violent now.
DEELA,I see no reason to make him feel any worse than he has to.
RAEL,Why do you care what he feels?
DEELA,"Rael, he's not one of us. He's temporary. (getting a message via"
RAEL,I have noted that.
DEELA,"I wonder if they will demonstrate it to us. Oh, Rael, stop"
DEELA,Go back to work.

DEELA,"The unit will be activated. By the time they hear this, it will"
KIRK,Why are you doing this?
DEELA,Do you really want to know? In a little while it won't matter to
KIRK,I really want to know.
DEELA,"Oh, dear. You are so stubborn. It should be obvious to you that"
KIRK,What about the rest of my crew?
DEELA,They'll remain here in suspended animation. It will do them no
KIRK,Not by killing others.
DEELA,You were doing exactly the same thing. You came charging into
KIRK,You invaded my ship. You threaten my crew.
DEELA,There is no difference.
KIRK,There is a difference! Your trouble is in you.
DEELA,We did not ask for it. We are not to blame. We are handling it
KIRK,"Did they solve anything? Have you tried any other way? Deela,"
ll do itDEELA,We have tried other ways. We've tried to make the transition to
DEELA,With the captain?
DEELA,Just what makes you think I would do that? The captain's gone.
RAEL,"Go after him, Deela."
MCCOY,"There's no question about it, Spock. I want you to take a look"
DEELA,Why did you run?
KIRK,I panicked.
DEELA,I don't believe that.
KIRK,I'd like to leave before he activates the suspended animation
DEELA, We're in the transporter room. You can
DEELA,Captain.
DEELA,"What have you done to the transporter, Captain?"
KIRK,It was working before. Try it again.
DEELA, The transporter isn't working.
RAEL,What'd he do to it?
DEELA,"It must be a, what do you call it? A"
KIRK,The technicians reported a loss of power. That must be it.
DEELA,The captain says his technicians
DEELA,I expect you to check into all possible causes. If I had a
KIRK,"Yes, of course."
DEELA,"I'm glad we're both innocents. I despise devious people, don't"
KIRK,I believe in honest relationships myself.
SPOCK,"Nurse, programme the information and"

KIRK,A room should reflect its occupant.
DEELA,Absolutely. May I freshen up? All this rushing about has left me
KIRK,"Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look."
DEELA,I wondered when you'd say something nice to me. Am I more
KIRK,A bit.
DEELA,It was quite delightful kissing you when you couldn't see me.
But now KIRK,But now.
DEELA,No. I wouldn't allow you to take that no matter how much we
KIRK,Was I too crude?
DEELA,Just don't try it again. You're far too vulnerable to skin
KIRK,Yes. I know.
DEELA,The difference between us is that you will come around to our
SPOCK,"Lieutenant, will you replay the Scalosian"
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
MCCOY,McCoy to Spock.
MCCOY,"I've found a tape in the computer down here, and when I try to"
SPOCK,"Lieutenant Uhura, notify the rest of the crew."
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Can we use phasers to cut through that wall, bypass the force"
SPOCK,"Mister Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level."
SCOTT,Can we find some way of coping with them on theirs?
SPOCK,That is a very logical suggestion. Stand by in the transporter
EKOR,"There's nothing wrong elsewhere, sir. Sufficient energy for"
RAEL,This is the only damage? Go get the others and bring them up
DEELA,Rael!
DEELA,"Rael, stop."
KIRK,No.
DEELA,"Now, stop it. Did he damage you, Captain?"
KIRK,No.
DEELA,"How very fortunate for you, Rael. Don't you dare do anything"
RAEL,Then don't torment me. You know how I feel.
DEELA,I don't care what your feelings are. I don't want to know that
RAEL,No. I have more work to do.
DEELA,Don't you think you'd better do it?
DEELA,He loves me. I adored him when I was a child. I suppose I still
KIRK,"Yes, I hope so."
DEELA,What did you say?
KIRK,I said I hoped I behaved correctly.
DEELA,And nothing bothers you now?
KIRK,Why are we here?
DEELA,Our leaving was delayed. Don't you remember? You damaged the
KIRK,"Oh, yes. That was wrong of me."
DEELA,"Yes, it certainly was."
KIRK,But we are going to Scalos?
DEELA,Do you want to?
KIRK,"Oh, yes."
DEELA,What about your crew? Aren't you worried about them?
KIRK,They'll be all right.
DEELA,Oh.
KIRK,What's the matter?
DEELA,"Nothing. You've completely accepted the situation, haven't you?"
KIRK,Am I behaving incorrectly?
DEELA,No! I liked you better before. Stubborn and irritating and
KIRK,Those are undesirable qualities.
DEELA,Maybe that's why I liked you so much. Because you were like him.
MCCOY,Finished.
SPOCK,"Yes, it counteracts the substance most effectively."
MCCOY,"Most effectively under laboratory conditions, but the question"
SPOCK,By drinking the Scalosian water. 
MCCOY,"Spock, you don't know what that'll do to you."
SPOCK,"It is somewhat stimulating. You seem to be moving very slowly,"
CHAPEL,He's gone.
MCCOY,Just like Compton.
RAEL,I've beamed the others down.
DEELA,Why didn't you tell me?
RAEL,It would've been an intrusion. Come up when
DEELA,Where will you be?
DEELA,"Rael, wait. I'm sorry."
RAEL,I know.
DEELA,"Well, come, Captain. It's time to leave your pretty ship."
RAEL,"The unit is activated, Deela. Beam down at once."
DEELA,Your crew will be all right. You said so
KIRK,I'm sorry.
DEELA, He's broken away. He's armed.
DEELA,"You are very clever, Captain. You tricked me. I should've known"
KIRK,We could put you in suspended animation until we determine what
DEELA,Your survival does not depend on that.
KIRK,"No, it doesn't. What do you want us to do with you?"
DEELA,"Don't make a game of it, Captain. We've lost."
KIRK,"If I sent you to Scalos, you'd undoubtedly play the same trick on"
DEELA,There won't be any others. You'll warn them. Your federation
KIRK,"Yes, I suppose it would."
DEELA,And we will die and solve your problem that way. And ours.
DEELA,"Now, what about your problem, Captain, and your Vulcan friend?"
SPOCK,If you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of
DEELA,You could still find life on Scalos very pleasant.
KIRK,And very brief.
DEELA,It'll be just as brief here. You cannot get back to your own
KIRK,"Oh, no. I can think of nothing I'd rather do than stay with you."
KIRK,Energise.
DEELA,"Goodbye, Captain."
KIRK,"Well, Mister Spock, what have you got?"
SPOCK,Doctor McCoy and I have synthesised a possible counteragent to
KIRK,Let's test it.  Nothing's
SPOCK,"You do seem to be moving very slowly, Captain."
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SCOTT,"Captain Kirk, where the blazes did you come from?"
KIRK,Out of the nowhere into the here.
SCOTT,"And Mister Spock, is he coming too?"
KIRK,Scotty.
SULU,Somebody's repairing every console on the
SCOTT,This panel is being recircuited at incredible speed.
KIRK,"I think we've located Mister Spock. Lieutenant, are your circuits"
UHURA,"Yes, sir."
KIRK,"Cancel Red Alert, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,Open all channels. Captain to crew. Repairs are now being
KIRK,"Mister Spock, my compliments to your repair work and yourself."
SPOCK,"Thank you, Captain. I found it an accelerating experience."
KIRK,Yes. No malfunctions anywhere? (sees the Scalosians on the

KIRK,No.

SPOCK,Still undistinguishable.
KIRK,Be careful.
MCCOY,She seems harmless enough.

MCCOY,"We can't keep referring to her as she, as if she weren't here."
KIRK,Do you have any ideas?
MCCOY,"Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going to call her Gem."

MCCOY,"Well, that's better than 'Hey, you.'"
KIRK,I want to know why we're here. I want to know what's going on.

MCCOY,"Captain!  Jim, what is it? What have they done to"
MCCOY,Help him. Don't be afraid to help him.
MCCOY,Jim. You lie still. I'll check her out right away.
KIRK,Will she live?
MCCOY,She seems fine now.
KIRK,Can you explain what happened?
MCCOY,Complete empathy. She must be a totally functional empath. Her
KIRK,She weakened. I could feel it. Is her life in danger?
MCCOY,"It's impossible to say yet, but supplying your body with life"
SPOCK,"Her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death, Doctor. Only"
MCCOY,That's true. Fear would naturally be her first reaction. Perhaps
KIRK,Could the strain really have killed her?
MCCOY,"Oh yes. However, I'd assume that her instinct for"
KIRK,I'm tired.
SPOCK,"Can you recall what happened, Captain?"
KIRK,"I remember the laboratory, and they wanted to know something. But"
MCCOY,Take it easy.
KIRK,What's the matter with me?
MCCOY,You have all the symptoms of the bends. Nitrogen bubbles in your
KIRK,You'll have to ask the Vians. Will I live?
MCCOY,"Well, you could use some time in a decompression chamber. But"
SPOCK,"Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you"
MCCOY,"Spock, why do you have to get so analytical at a time like"
KIRK,"No, he's right. Continue."
SPOCK,I conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this
KIRK,Can you tap into it?
SPOCK,"If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates,"
KIRK,And get us out of here the same way we were brought in.
SPOCK,I would say so.
KIRK,Then I would say proceed.
LAL,You are called Captain. You are responsible for the lives of your
KIRK,It is.
THANN,We find it necessary to have the co-operation of one of your men
KIRK,We will not co-operate.
LAL,"When we resume our interrogations, you will decide which of your"
KIRK,"How's it coming, Spock?"
SPOCK,"I do not know, Captain. I'm beginning to understand its"
MCCOY,"Spock, It won't be long before the Vians come back. You better"
KIRK,"Take it easy, Bones."
MCCOY,Men weren't intended to live this far underground. It's just not
KIRK,And space travel is?
SPOCK,Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the
MCCOY,"I'm a doctor, not a coal miner."
SPOCK,"I've recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder,"
MCCOY,I'm not a mechanic. I couldn't get that thing to work no matter
SPOCK,"Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to"
MCCOY,"In any case, Spock, you're the logical one to leave with the"
KIRK,"The decision's mine. If there are any decisions to be made, I'll"
KIRK,I don't need any
MCCOY,I'm still Chief Medical Officer of the Enterprise. I'll tell you
SPOCK,"How long will he be asleep, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"Between the emotional strain and that attack of bends, he's in"
SPOCK,"I'm not criticizing your action, Doctor. On the contrary, I'm"
MCCOY,How?
SPOCK,"While the captain is asleep, I am in command. When the Vians"
MCCOY,"You mean, if I hadn't given him that shot"
SPOCK,Precisely. The choice would have been the captain's. Now it is
SPOCK,Your action is highly unethical. My decision stands.
MCCOY,"Not this time, Spock."
MCCOY,The choice has been made.  You stay here with my
THANN,"Come, then."
LAL,"Doctor, please understand that if there was any other way to"
accomplish our purpose MCCOY,Get on with it.
KIRK,Why did you let him do it?
SPOCK,"I was convinced in the same way you were, Captain. By the good"
KIRK,Anything?
SPOCK,"Hmm. A most unusual device. It is a control unit, but not a"
KIRK,What exactly is it?
SPOCK,"This control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy, the"
KIRK,"Can you adapt it, re-attune it to fit our brain pattern?"
SPOCK,"I shall attempt to do so. However, it is not possible to adjust"
I KIRK,"Do whatever you have to to make it work, Spock. What disturbs me"
SPOCK,Fascinating. They must have known we were capable of
KIRK,And that we would use it to escape.
SPOCK,The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go.
KIRK,And they keep McCoy.
SPOCK,"That is evidently their intention, Captain."
KIRK," Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this."
SPOCK,"Indeed, the facts would indicate that she's essential to their"
KIRK,"Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it? Has all the pain and"
SPOCK,"Completed, Captain. The adjustments are delicate. They may not"
KIRK,Will it take us to McCoy?
SPOCK,If you so desire.
KIRK,"The best defence is a strong offense, and I intend to start"
KIRK,Bones. Spock. Get him down. His wrists. 
SPOCK,Severe heart damage. Signs of congestion in both lungs. Evidence
MCCOY,I
KIRK,Don't talk. Don't speak. Take it easy until we get you back to
SPOCK,"He's dying, Jim. We can make him comfortable, but that is all."
KIRK,You don't know. You're not a doctor.
SPOCK,Internal injuries. Bleeding in the chest and abdomen.
MCCOY,"He's right, Jim. Being a doctor has its drawbacks. I always"
KIRK,How long?
SPOCK,It could happen anytime.
MCCOY,"The correct medical phrase, ay, Spock? You've got a a good"
KIRK,Can't we do something?
SPOCK,I'm afraid not.
KIRK,"Gem might be able to help him, the way she helped me, but could"
SPOCK,"Uncertain, Captain. Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes"
KIRK,If she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking
LAL,No interference will be permitted.
KIRK,She can save his life. Let us help her to go to him.
LAL,She must not be urged or forced to take action.
THANN,All must proceed without interference.
LAL,The purpose that brought us together
KIRK,"What purpose can all this serve, except the fulfilment of some"
LAL,"We have but one need left in life, and that is to see the"
THANN,Be patient.
KIRK,Patient? Our friend is dying.
THANN,Perhaps.
SPOCK,"What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to"
THANN,We know.
SPOCK,Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its
LAL,That is why we are here.
KIRK,This arena of death that you have devised for your pleasure. Will
LAL,"No, it will not, but it may save Gem's planet. Of all the planets"
THANN,"If Gem's planet is the one that will be saved, we must make"
KIRK,How will the death of our friend serve this purpose?
LAL,"His death will not serve it, but her willingness to give her life"
KIRK,We were? What could she learn from us?
LAL,Your will to survive. Your love of life. Your passion to know.
THANN,Her planet will be fortunate.
LAL,Each of you is willing to give his life for the others. We must
THANN,Time grows short.
SPOCK,"You were correct, Captain. Everything that has occurred here has"
THANN,No. We only created the circumstances. That was necessary.
LAL,Your actions were spontaneous. Everything that is truest and best
THANN,Behold. That is most significant. An instinct new to the essence
LAL,Compassion for another is becoming part of her functioning life
THANN,She is afraid.
LAL,She's saving herself. She does not yet have the instinct to save
THANN,We have failed?
LAL,"No. No, not yet."
SPOCK,"Captain, Dr. McCoy's life is not solely dependent on Gem. The"
THANN,True.
KIRK,Then you cannot let him die.
LAL,His death is not important. We must wait to see whether her
MCCOY,Don't touch me. Stay away. Jim. Spock. Are you here?
KIRK,"Yes, Bones."
MCCOY,"Don't let her touch me. She'll die. Jim, I can't destroy life,"
SPOCK,Captain?
KIRK,What is it?
SPOCK,The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the
KIRK,"Yes, I know."
SPOCK,"It draws its energy from us, Captain. In spite of what we see,"
KIRK,I'll try.
KIRK,Yes.
KIRK,Spock.
LAL,You cannot use our powers to change what is happening.
KIRK,You must save the life of our friend.
LAL,No. We will not. Her instinct must be developed to the fullest.
SPOCK,It is complete. Gem has earned the right of survival for her
LAL,To offer is not proof enough.
KIRK,"If death is all you understand, here are four lives for you."
KIRK,We will not leave our friend. You've lost the capacity to feel
LAL,Farewell.
KIRK,Strange.
SPOCK,"What is puzzling you, Captain?"
KIRK,"I'm not puzzled, Mister Spock. I am awed."
MCCOY,"I'm with you, Captain. She awed me."
KIRK,"No, no. I wasn't thinking of Gem. I was thinking of that"
SPOCK,"Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a"

KIRK,"What, Scott?"

MCCOY,"Well, personally, I find it fascinating that with all their"

PETRI,That must wait until the Dohlman is aboard.
KIRK,Dohlman? What the devil is a Dohlman?
PETRI,The thing most feared and hated by my

KIRK,I'm Captain Kirk. This ship is under my command.
KRYTON,There's a Troyian here. I must know that all is secure before
KIRK,This ship is secure and we're prepared for any hostile acts.
KRYTON,Do honour to the Dohlman of Elas.
KRYTON,"Glory to Elaan, Dohlman of Elas."
KRYTON,You may stand.
KIRK,"Body armour, nuclear weapons."
SPOCK,"Not without precedent, Captain. Remember that"
KRYTON,Permission to speak was not given.
ELAAN,You rule this ship?
SPOCK,I am the first officer. This is Captain James Kirk.
PETRI,"Your Glory, I am Petri. In the name of my people"
ELAAN,"Your mission is known to us. Captain Kirk, you have now"
KIRK,"Well, now, just a moment. There's going to have to be some kind"
PETRI,Please.
KIRK,My first officer Mister Spock will show you to your quarters.
ELAAN,You have not been dismissed.
KIRK,May I have your permission to go?
ELAAN,You are now dismissed.
KIRK,"Why, thank you. Ambassador."
KIRK,"Ambassador, I think it's time you told me"
PETRI,"That creature, Elaan, is to be the wife of our ruler to bring"
KIRK,"I see. So, we go back to Troyius."
PETRI,"Yes. But slowly, Captain. I will need time. Before we reach"
KIRK,And you are to be her teacher?
PETRI,"Those are my orders. I must ask you and your crew to respect, or"
KIRK,"Yes, that I can understand."
PETRI,"Another thing you should understand, Captain. You have as much"
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Troyius."
SULU,"Impulse drive, Captain?"
KIRK,"Yes, that's correct, Mister Sulu. Sublight factor point zero"
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,Captain? You'll not be using the warp drive? All the way on
KIRK,"You in a hurry, Mister Scott?"
SCOTT,No.
SPOCK,"Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided."
UHURA,"What's the matter with them, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational."
UHURA,I gave up my quarters because I

KRYTON,He came in answer to your summons.
KIRK,I understand you're not happy with your quarters.
ELAAN,Quarters! 
KIRK,"Yes, not happy at all."
ELAAN,Am I a soft Troyian fawn to need pillows to sit on? And these
KIRK,My communications officer generously vacated the rooms hoping you

PETRI,I explained to Her Glory that her council of nobles and the

ELAAN,I will never forgive the council for putting me through this
KIRK,There are none better. I suggest you make do with these.
ELAAN,You suggest?
KIRK,"There are no more available, but if that's the only way you can"
ELAAN,I will not be humiliated!
KIRK,Then act in a civilised fashion.
ELAAN,I did not give you permission to leave!
KIRK,I didn't ask for any.
PETRI,"Captain, I wish to contact my government. I"
KIRK,Ambassador! This is supposed to be a peaceful mission.
PETRI,There cannot be peace between us. We have deluded ourselves.

SPOCK,None in this area. Nothing that would account for it. The ghost

SPOCK,"Captain, we had a momentary fix on the object enough to"
KIRK,Whose?
SPOCK,No data yet.

UHURA,"Captain Kirk. May I speak with you, sir?"
KIRK,Yes. Certainly.
UHURA,A message just came from Starfleet Command. It was class-A
KIRK,What was it?
UHURA,The Federation High Commissioner is on his way to Troyius to

PETRI,It's not magic. It's biochemical. A man whose flesh is once

MCCOY,The fat will be in the fire when he learns the bride just tried
PETRI,There will be no wedding. I would not have our ruler marry that

MCCOY,"It'll be a few days. A week, at least, Jim."

ELAAN,"So, Ambassador Petri is going to recover? That is too bad. You"
KIRK,"Nothing would please me more, Your Glory. But your impetuous"
nature ELAAN,"Your Troyian pig was here in my quarters without any permission,"
KIRK,You Elasians pride yourselves on being a warrior people. You must
ELAAN,I despise Troyians. Any contact with them makes me feel soiled.
KIRK,It's been my experience that the prejudices people feel about
ELAAN,It's not in my experience.
KIRK,"Well, we're still faced with the same problem."
ELAAN,Problem?
KIRK,"Yes, the problem of your indoctrination to Troyian customs and"
ELAAN,I have eliminated that problem.
KIRK,You have eliminated the teacher. The problem still remains.
ELAAN,Oh. And how do we solve the problem?
KIRK,By giving you a new teacher.
ELAAN,"Tell me, what can you teach me?"
KIRK,"Table manners, for one thing. This is a plate. It contains food."
ELAAN,Leave me!
KIRK,"Like it or not, you're going to learn what you've been ordered to"
ELAAN,You will return me to Elas immediately.
KIRK,That's impossible.
ELAAN,Everything I order is possible.
KIRK,That's the first problem we're going to work on. Then we'll get
ELAAN,"I will not go to Troyius, I will not be mated to a Troyian, and"
KIRK,You enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman.
ELAAN,Nobody speaks to me that way.
KIRK,That's another one of your problems. Nobody's told you that
KIRK,That's no way to treat someone who's telling you the truth.
KIRK,Tomorrow's lesson will be on courtesy.
KIRK,"Lieutenant, open up the hailing frequency,"
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
UHURA,"Captain, no response from the Klingon vessel on any channel."
KIRK,"I see. All right, Lieutenant. Monitor all frequencies. Phaser"
WATSON,What are you doing?
ELASIAN,No one may enter the Dohlman's presence.
KIRK,Where's Kryton?
ELASIAN,On business. No one may enter the Dohlman's presence.
KIRK,Will you tell Her Glory that Captain Kirk requests the honour of
ELASIAN,The Dohlman has promised I'll be whipped to death if I let

KIRK,"Mister Spock, the women on your planet are logical. That's the"
ELAAN,You dare touch a member of the royal family.
KIRK,"Only in self-defence. Now, are you going to behave or not?"
ELAAN,The penalty is death for what you are doing.
KIRK,We're not on Elas. We're on my starship. I command here.
ELAAN,"You are warned, Captain, never to touch me again."
KIRK,"If I touch you again, Your Glory, it'll be to administer an"
ELAAN,You have my leave to go.
KIRK,"You forget, Your Glory, we haven't started your lesson in"
ELAAN,"You can teach me nothing, Captain. If I have to stay here for"
KIRK,"Very well. I'll send in Mister Spock or Doctor McCoy. Either way,"
ELAAN,"Captain, there is one thing you can teach me."
KIRK,"No, no, you were right the first time. There's nothing I can"
ELAAN,I don't know how to make people like me. I don't want everybody
KIRK,"Well, it's not it's not that people hate you. It's just that"
KIRK,"It's, er, gotten very, er. Something must've gone wrong with the"
ELAAN,Captain?
KIRK,"Pardon me, Your Glory. There will be a short recess."
ELAAN,Captain.
ELAAN,"Captain, that ancient Earth custom called spanking, what is it?"
KIRK,"It's, er, It's, er. We'll talk about it later."
UHURA,"Bridge to Captain Kirk. Mister Spock, I'm getting"
SPOCK,"I have it on my sensor, Lieutenant."
UHURA,"Bridge to Captain Kirk. Come in, please. Captain Kirk, please"
UHURA,"Oh, Captain, I'm picking up a transmission from inside the"
KIRK,Inside the Enterprise? Can you pinpoint it?
KIRK,Security to Engineering. Intruder alert. Security alert to all
SCOTT,"Nobody saw him, but that devil sneaked back in here some way."
KIRK,It's Klingon. Bones?
MCCOY,Neck snapped clean.
KIRK,What kind of signal did you send the Klingon ship?
KRYTON,"Captain, you must know I will tell you nothing. Our"
KIRK,"Yes, I'm aware you're trained to resist any form of physical"
KIRK,"Mister Spock, it was Kryton transmitting. He refuses to talk."
SECURITY,"Captain, I'm sorry. He seemed"
KIRK,What was he trying to cover that was so important he felt he had
SCOTT,"Captain, you must realise the time"
KIRK,Don't waste the time telling me about it. Get to it.
SCOTT,Aye.
ELAAN,Kryton was of a noble family. He loved me
KIRK,He sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy?
ELAAN,Probably. But why speak of unimportant matters when we can speak
KIRK,There's a Klingon warship out there. What's their involvement?
ELAAN,We should welcome their help.
KIRK,"Elaan. Elaan, two planets, an entire star system's stability"
ELAAN,Could you do that? Could you give me to another man?
KIRK,My orders and yours say that you belong to another man. What
ELAAN,"It was no accident. I chose you, and you chose me. I have a"
KIRK,What kind of a mind could think of such a thing?
ELAAN,He's a Troyian.
ELAAN,"You cannot resist my love, my love."
SPOCK,May we see you a moment?
MCCOY,Jim. Jim! May we please have a word with you?
SPOCK,"Captain, are you all right?"
MCCOY,"Did she cry, Jim?"
KIRK,What?
MCCOY,Did she cry? Did her tears touch you at any time?
MCCOY,"Oh, we're in trouble. Now listen, Jim. Petri told Christine that"
SPOCK,"It is true then, Captain?"
KIRK,"It's true. Bones, you've got to find me an antidote."
MCCOY,"I'll try, but I'll need tests and"
KIRK,Captain here.
KIRK,I'm on my way. Battle stations.
KIRK,Phasers stand by.
SULU,"Phasers ready, sir."
SPOCK,"Their speed is better than warp six, Captain."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course to take us out of this star"
CHEKOV,"Course computed, sir."
SULU,"Laid in, Captain."
KIRK,All right. Ahead warp factor two.

SULU,"Aye, sir. One hundred thousand kilometres. Ninety. Eighty."
KIRK,"Phaser crews, stand by to fire on command."
SULU,Sixty.
KIRK,Ready.
SULU,Fifty.
KIRK,Hold your fire.
SULU,She's passed us without firing a shot.
SPOCK,I don't think they meant to attack us. We were very fortunate
KIRK,"Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mister Spock. They were"
SPOCK,Very. But why do the Klingons consider the possession of this
KIRK,"Yes, a very good question, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"I have another question, Captain. Is not the bridge the wrong"
KIRK,"I'll be the judge. Yes, you're quite right. Thank you, Mister"
ELAAN,I want to be by your side.
KIRK,"Your presence here is interfering with my efficiency, my ability"
KIRK,Deck five.
ELAAN,"I love you. I have chosen you, and still I don't understand why"
KIRK,"If I can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running, I'll"
ELAAN,And that mission is to take me to Troyius.
KIRK,Yes.
ELAAN,Would you have me wearing my wedding dress for another man and
KIRK,"Yes, Elaan."
ELAAN,Are you happy at the prospect?
KIRK,No.
KIRK,Kirk here.
SCOTT,"I've got bad news, Captain. The entire"
KIRK,No chance of restoring warp drive?
KIRK,"Kirk out. Elaan, I have to go back to the Bridge. Please, you"
ELAAN,"Yes, my love."
CHAPEL,Test number twenty four. Colladium trioxide
MCCOY,Results also negative.
PETRI,"Doctor, there is no antidote to the poison of Elasian tears. The"
MCCOY,"It is my time to waste, Ambassador."
ELAAN,Doctor? The Captain asked me to come here for safety.
PETRI,"Safety? What is your estimate of our chances for survival,"
MCCOY,"That is the captain's responsibility, Ambassador."
UHURA,"Captain, message from the Klingon ship."
SPOCK,They demand an immediate reply.
KIRK,"They're trying to force a fight. Scotty, what's our energy"
SCOTT,"Ninety three percent of impulse power, sir."
SPOCK,We can still manoeuvre.
SCOTT,"Our shields will hold for a few passes, but"
KIRK,And let the Klingons know they succeeded in
SPOCK,Help could not arrive before the Enterprise would be destroyed.
PETRI,"Now that we are all about to die, I ask you"
ELAAN,"That's all you men of other worlds can speak of, duty and"
KIRK,"We'll stall for time, proceed on course and"
UHURA,"Frequency open, sir."
KIRK,This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise on Federation
KIRK,I'd say our strategy wasn't totally effective.
SULU,"Captain, the Klingon ship is closing on an intercept course. Five"
KIRK,"Scotty, can you give me partial power on the phaser banks?"
SULU,Three hundred thousand kilometres.
KIRK,I told you to stay in Sickbay.
ELAAN,I want to die with you.
KIRK,We're not going to die. Now get off the bridge.
SULU,One hundred thousand kilometres.
SPOCK,He's passed us. All shields held.
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, bring her to one four three mark two. Keep our"
SULU,"Here he comes again, sir."
KIRK,Stay with the controls. Keep our forward shields to him.
SPOCK,Better than warp seven.
KIRK,"Hard over, Sulu. Bring her around. He's going for our flank."
SULU,"Sorry, Captain. She won't respond fast enough on impulse."
SPOCK,He's past us again. Damage to number four shield.
KIRK,How bad?
SPOCK,"It will not withstand another full charge, Captain. I'm getting"
SULU,He's paralleling us again. He seems to have broken off the
KIRK,"What sort of readings, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,She is the source.
KIRK,Elaan?
SPOCK,The necklace.
KIRK,What kind of jewels are in this?
ELAAN,They call them radans. The necklace is supposed to bring you
SPOCK,"These are common stones?  See, Captain? Here and"
KIRK,Common stones? Now I see why the Klingons are interested in this
ELAAN,"If I can be of any help, of course."
KIRK,"You may have just saved our lives. Mister Spock, do you think"
SPOCK,"No doubt, Captain."
SULU,"He's coming in again, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, prepare on my order to turn quickly to port. Try and"
SULU,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Now, Sulu. hard a-port!"
SULU,"Shields holding, but weakened, sir."

UHURA,"Channel open, sir."
KIRK,This is Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise.
KIRK,"Scotty, your estimate."
SCOTT,"We're fitting it now, sir, but we'll have to"
KIRK,Test it in combat.
SPOCK,"Captain, these are crude crystals. There is"
that could blow us up just aseffectively as KIRK,Let me know when it's in place. Open a hailing frequency.
UHURA,"Hailing frequency open, sir."
KIRK,This is the Enterprise. Will you guarantee the safety of our

SCOTT,"It's in place, sir, but I can't answer for"
KIRK,"You and Spock get up here. Sulu, prepare for"
SULU,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Chekov, arm photon torpedoes."
CHEKOV,Photon torpedoes ready.
SULU,"Warp power to the shields, Captain?"
KIRK,Negative. His sensors will pick up our power increase. The more
SULU,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, give him a full spread of photon torpedoes."
CHEKOV,"Aye, Captain."
SULU,One hundred thousand kilometres.
KIRK,"Scotty, stand by to cut in warp drive."
SCOTT,Fluctuation. It's the shape of the crystals. I was afraid of
SULU,Seventy five. Seventy. Sixty. Fifty.
KIRK,Fire at minimum range.
SULU,Forty.
SCOTT,She won't steady down.
SULU,Thirty.
KIRK,"Warp in, Scotty. Full power to shields."
KIRK,Warp factor two. Bring us to course one four eight mark three.
KIRK,"Chekov, photon torpedoes. Fire!"
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
SULU,Direct hit amidships by photon torpedo.
SPOCK,Damage to Klingon number three shield. Number four shield
CHEKOV,"He's badly damaged, Captain. Continuing away at reduced speed."
KIRK,"Secure from general quarters. Well done, Mister Sulu. Scotty."
ELAAN,But I don't understand you. You mean you won't pursue and finish
KIRK,"No. Mister Sulu, resume course for Troyius."
SULU,"Aye, aye, sir."
ELAAN,You will not beam down for the ceremony?
KIRK,No.
ELAAN,I want you to have this as a personal memento. I have learned
KIRK,I have no choice.
ELAAN,Nor have I. I have only responsibilities and obligations.
KIRK,Goodbye. Energise.
SCOTT, It's stabilised now.
MCCOY,"Spock, I've isolated the biochemical substance of the Elasian"
SPOCK,"You are too late, Doctor. The Captain has found his own"
MCCOY,Are you out of your Vulcan mind? Do you know how long I've
worked on SPOCK,"The antidote to a woman of Elas, Doctor, is a starship. The"

MCCOY,"Well, I doubt seriously if there's any kind of an antidote for"

KIRK,"Donald, good to see you."
SPOCK,Governor.
CORY,"Gentlemen, you don't know what a treat this is for me. It's been"
KIRK,We'd be delighted.
SPOCK,"Governor, you indicated one additional inmate since our last"
CORY,"It is. The rehabilitation programme isn't progressing too well,"
KIRK,"Why, Donald, are you becoming a pessimist?"
CORY,I'm afraid I have.
SPOCK,A total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what
CORY,"Garth. Garth of Izar, a former Starship fleet Captain."
KIRK,"When I was a cadet at the Academy, his exploits were required"
CORY,Of course.
MARTA, Captain! You're making a mistake.
CORY,"Captain Kirk is pressed for time at the moment, Marta."
MARTA,There's nothing the matter with me! Can't you see just by
SPOCK,"She sounds rational enough, Captain."
MARTA,I am rational.
KIRK,What is it you want to tell me?
MARTA,I can't tell you in front of him.
KIRK,You're afraid to talk in front of Governor Cory?
MARTA,"He isn't really Governor Cory at all, that's just it."
CORY,She's been saying that for days now. Our medical staff can't
CORY,"Here's Garth. He's been unusually disturbed, and we've had to"
KIRK,Cory?
CORY," Yes, Jim, I'm Cory. It's true. He tricked you."
GARTH,"You said you wanted to see me, Captain. Well, here I am."
GARTH,"Your Vulcan friend is still alive, Captain. My phaser was set to"
KIRK,"Garth, do you have to make him suffer like that?"
GARTH,"You will address me by my proper title, Kirk."
KIRK,I'm sorry. I should've said Captain Garth.
GARTH,"I am Lord Garth, formerly of Izar, and I lead the future masters"
KIRK,"I'm sorry, Lord Garth."
GARTH,"You Earth people are a stiff necked lot, aren't you?"
KIRK,Release him.
GARTH,I'm afraid that subjugating you won't be enough. You must be
CORY,"Captain Garth, listen to me."
GARTH,"Oh ho! Our beloved governor has decided to address us, and we"
KIRK,Are you so afraid of him that you must keep him pinned?
GARTH, I'm afraid of no one. You're all powerless
KIRK,Thank you. Now what have you done with the medicine?
GARTH,The medicine? You mean the poison. I destroyed it.
KIRK,Destroyed it? It was your only hope.
GARTH,"Silence! The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies me, and it's"
KIRK,Of course.
GARTH,My crew mutinied. The first use I will make of the Enterprise is
KIRK,The crew of the Enterprise will also mutiny.
GARTH,"But they won't. You see, Captain, there's a helpful technique"
MARTA,"Good bye, darling. I'll miss you."
KIRK,"Governor Cory, how do you feel?"
CORY,All right. There is no help for any of us if that madman is in
KIRK,How does he manage to change form at will?
CORY,The people of Antos taught him the techniques of cellular
KIRK,He was such a genius. What a waste.
KIRK,Force field is on. Good. Remain here out of sight until I give
SCOTT,"Scott here, sir."
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. Queen to queen's level three."
SCOTT,"I said, queen to queen's level three."
SCOTT,"I'm following your orders, Captain. Queen to queen's level"
KIRK, No! No! No! (ends up
SCOTT,I gave him the sign. Why didn't he give me
MCCOY,Something's wrong.
SCOTT,Using the chess problem was the Captain's own suggestion. He
UHURA,"Aye, sir. There's no response, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,Send an armed detail to the transporter room immediately.
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
SCOTT,"Mister Sulu, what do your sensors show?"
SULU,"We can't beam anybody down, sir. The force field on the planet is"
SCOTT,"We could blast our way through the field, but only at the risk"
MCCOY,How can we be powerful enough to wipe out a planet and still be
GARTH,"We are going to take the Enterprise, do you"
GARTH,"Captain? Captain Kirk? Well, I hope you"
KIRK,"Thank you for your concern. All in all, it's been rather restful."
GARTH,"Good. Still, I've been quite remiss in my duties as your host. I"
KIRK,I'd forgotten.
GARTH,But I haven't. You and Mister Spock are to be my guests.
KIRK,Where is Mister Spock?
GARTH,Right here. Marta!
MARTA,Why can't I blow off just one of his ears?
GARTH,"Stop that, Marta. Mister Spock will think we're lacking in"
KIRK,"How are you, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Very well indeed, thank you, Captain."
KIRK,Isn't Governor Cory joining us?
GARTH,"No, the governor doesn't seem to be on the guest list."
KIRK,An oversight?
GARTH,An intentional one. The governor's fasting.
KIRK,"In that case, we must decline with thanks."
GARTH, Captain.
CORY,"Don't be a fool, Jim. Go along with him."
GARTH,"Good advice, Governor. Well, Captain? You'll find we set a"
KIRK,You're very persuasive.
GARTH,"Yes, I am. I certainly am."
GARTH,Keep your hands off Kirk! You treacherous thing!
MARTA,You're jealous!
GARTH,I am above that sort of thing. The Captain is annoyed by your
MARTA,"Am I annoying you, dearest?"
KIRK,Not really.
MARTA,He finds me fascinating and you're bothered by it. Admit it.
GARTH,I may have you beaten to death.
MARTA,"No, you won't, because I am the most beautiful woman on this"
GARTH,"You're the only woman on this planet, you stupid cow."
MARTA,"Well, I'm the most beautiful woman in this galaxy!"
GARTH,You're repulsive!
MARTA,"I'm beautiful! And I'm intelligent too. I write poetry, and I"
GARTH,Lies! All lies! You are the greatest liar I have ever met! Let

SPOCK," If you could create a diversion, I might be able to"
KIRK,"All we need is a few seconds, if Scotty has alerted the security"
GARTH,"Gentlemen, courtesy for the performer."
MARTA,Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and
s lease hath all too soon GARTH,You wrote that?
MARTA,"Yesterday, as a matter of fact."
GARTH,It was written by an Earth man named Shakespeare a long time
MARTA,Which does not alter the fact that I wrote it again yesterday! I
GARTH,I may kill you with my bare hands! 
GARTH,"Marvellous, isn't she, Captain?"
KIRK,"Yes, er, incredible."
GARTH,"What is your reaction, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"I find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic, if I"
GARTH,Nostalgic?
SPOCK,Yes. It is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that Vulcan
GARTH,"She's yours if you wish, Captain."
KIRK,"Oh, er, thank you. That's, er, very magnanimous of you."
GARTH,You'll find that I am magnanimous to my friends and merciless to
SPOCK,"On what, precisely, is our friendship to be based?"
GARTH,"Upon the firmest of foundations, Mister Spock. Enlightened self"
KIRK,"That's very flattering. I am primarily an explorer now, Captain"
GARTH,And so have I been. I have charted more new worlds than any man
KIRK,And tried to destroy Antos Four. SPOCK: Why?
GARTH,"Well, I could say because they were actively hostile to the"
KIRK,"Yes, you could say, but that would be untrue."
GARTH,"Agreed. Actually they were quite harmless, and they made me"
SPOCK,"How could you, a Starship fleet Captain, believe that a"
GARTH,That was my only miscalculation. I had changed. I had risen
KIRK,"I agree there was a time when war was necessary, and you were our"
GARTH,As well it should be.
KIRK,Very well. But my first visit to Axanar was as a new fledged

KIRK,"They were humanitarians and statesmen, and they had a dream. A"
GARTH,"Mister Spock, do you consider Captain Kirk and yourself"
SPOCK,Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue

GARTH,"Out there waiting for me. They will flock to my cause, and for"
SPOCK,Captain Garth
GARTH,Lord Garth!
SPOCK,"As you wish. At any rate, you must be aware of the fact that you"
GARTH,I was betrayed and treated barbarically.
SPOCK,"On the contrary. You were treated with justice, and with"
one must assume GARTH,Remove this animal!
GARTH,"Try some of this wine, Captain. It has a robust, full bodied"
KIRK,No thank you. I prefer to join Mister Spock.
GARTH,"And I prefer that you remain here. Marta, my dear. We found your"
KIRK,Occasionally.
GARTH,So do I. How would you respond to queen to queen's level three?
KIRK,I'm sure you're aware that there are an infinite number of
GARTH,I'm interested in only one.
KIRK,I can't for the life of me imagine which one.
GARTH,For the life of me is a phrase well chosen. It could literally

GARTH,"But I can make you long for death, beg for death."
MARTA,"In the midnight of November, when the dead man's fare is nigh,"
KIRK,"Yes, I think it's very good."
MARTA,Tell him what he wants to know and we'll go away together.
KIRK,I can't.
MARTA,But you must. I beg of you.
GARTH,"Oh, don't beg, Marta! It's degrading. Queen to queen's level"
KIRK,"Yes, I recognise it. It's used for rehabilitation purposes."
CORY,It helped many men back to health.
GARTH,Appearances can be deceiving. Once it was a part of the
GARTH,"Interesting, isn't it? The pain is real and can be prolonged"
KIRK,Stop it!
GARTH,"Of course, Captain. You have but to ask. Now, as you can see, he"
KIRK,No.
GARTH,Too bad. Remove our distinguished governor. Put Captain Kirk in
MARTA,"No, you mustn't do that!"
GARTH,"You really are becoming offensive to me, my dear. Don't make it"
MARTA,"Please, stop it!"
GARTH,"You want him, don't you?"
MARTA,Yes.
GARTH,Badly enough to join him?
MARTA,"Listen to me, my Lord Garth. I can get him to tell me what you"
GARTH,It might be interesting to have you try.
SCOTT,No breakthrough?
UHURA,"No, Mister Scott. Still no response from the planet."
SCOTT,Sensor readings?
SULU,The force field is weakest on the far side of the planet. We can

SCOTT,"Aye, you're right. Even if they made it, they couldn't carry"
MCCOY,Probably kill Jim and Spock.
SCOT,"Doctor, they may already be dead."
MARTA,"Slowly, darling, slowly. Rest."
KIRK,"Is this more of Garth's persuasion, Marta?"
MARTA,I told him I'd discover your secret. I lied. I would have told
KIRK,I believe you mean that.
MARTA,I do.  This is where I've longed to be. I think I

MARTA,That's not possible.
KIRK,"Yes, it is. It is if I can get to the control room and remove the"
MARTA,Garth is my leader.
KIRK,He will lead you to destruction. He's already destroyed the
MARTA,"I'll help you, but you must wait. You do see that, don't you?"
Soon your friend Spock will be here and then KIRK,Spock?
MARTA,At least I've arranged that much.
KIRK,How did you manage that?
MARTA,A convincing lie told to a guard who finds me desirable.
MARTA,"No, you mustn't stop me. He's my lover and I have to kill him."
SPOCK,She seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring
KIRK,I'm very glad to see you.
SPOCK,"Thank you, Captain.  We're now armed. I presume"
KIRK,"Yes, you presume correctly."
SPOCK,"Force field is now off, Captain."
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
UHURA,"Mister Scott, it's the captain."
SCOTT,"Scott here, Captain."
KIRK,"Mister Scott, I want a fully armed security detail beamed down"
SCOTT,"They're already in the transporter room,"
KIRK,And have Doctor McCoy prepare additional

SPOCK,I also request permission to remain here in charge of the

SPOCK,"Mister Scott, the Captain's life is in immediate danger. Beam"
SPOCK,"He's waiting for the proper reply, Captain."
KIRK,"Scotty, Mister Spock will give the countersign."
SPOCK,"Give him the countersign, Captain."
GARTH,"Blast away, Captain, if you can. Do you think I'm fool enough to"
KIRK,What have you done with Spock? Where is he?
GARTH,"I have done nothing with him as of yet, but I do have plans for"
KIRK,Captain Garth
GARTH,Lord Garth!
KIRK,"No, sir. Captain Garth, Starship fleet Captain. That's an"
GARTH,"And I was the greatest of them all, wasn't I?"
KIRK,"Yes, you were. Yes. But you're a sick man now, sir."
GARTH,I have never been more healthy.
KIRK,"No. No, think. Think back to what you were before the accident"
GARTH,I can't remember. It's almost as if I had died and was reborn.
KIRK,"No, I, I can remember. You were the finest student at the"
GARTH,"Yes, I do remember that. It was a great responsibility, but one"
KIRK,"And you bore it well. And the disease that changed you, it's not"
GARTH,"I don't want to hear any more. You're weak, you're trying to"
KIRK,"No, I'm not. I want you to find what you once had. I want you to"
GARTH,I am Lord Garth! Master of the universe! You doubt me only
KIRK,"No, sir, listen to me. I"
GARTH,Stop! On your knees.
KIRK,No.
GARTH,On your knees before me! All the others before me have failed.
GARTH,The throne must be higher. It must be higher than anything else
KIRK,Coronation?
GARTH,"Yes. Oh, I know that even a real throne is no more than merely a"
KIRK,"Yes, I agree. You'll wear a crown too, I presume?"
GARTH,"But again, just as a token. Not impressive in itself, but it"
KIRK,"Garth, you have only a handful of men."
GARTH,"You do refuse to enter into the spirit of the thing, don't you,"
KIRK,"No, I wouldn't enjoy that at all. Besides, you seem to need me"
GARTH,"How true. All right, how about crown prince? That would make you"
GARTH,"Well, since there is no one mighty enough to perform this"
GARTH,Now remove our heir apparent that we may conclude this ceremony.
KIRK,Listen to me. This may be our last chance.
GARTH,"Well done. Well, Captain, you continue to resist. How stupid of"
GARTH,"Now, it is true that she is deadly as a poisonous serpent, but"
GARTH,"But I've arranged a more merciful end for her because after all,"
GARTH,"Poor girl. Poor, dear, suffering child. I will help her now."
SULU,There's been an explosion on Elba Two!
SCOTT,Point nine five!
MCCOY,It must've wiped out everything.
SCOTT,"Immediate probe. Is the force field in place, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,"Yes, sir. Solidly."
UHURA, Life continues to exist on the planet.
MCCOY,Got to break through it somehow.
SCOTT,"Doctor, I told you we couldn't do it without killing everyone in"
MCCOY,"I know it, Scotty."
SCOTT,"Well, there's one last thing we might try. Perhaps the ship's"
SULU,"On the far side of the planet, Mister Scott."
MCCOY,Will it leave a margin of safety for the people below?
SULU,"Yes, sir."
SCOTT,"Prepare to change orbital path, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Orbital co-ordinates released, sir."
SCOTT,Break synchronous orbit. Come to course one four mark six eight.
SULU,"Course one four mark six eight. Synchronous orbit re-established,"
SCOTT,Ship's phasers to narrow beam.

GARTH,"How are your nerves, Kirk?"
KIRK,"All I can say, Garth, if it happens to me, it happens to you."
GARTH,"You're an extraordinary fellow, Kirk. Your stubbornness defies"
GARTH,"Spock is not only a more logical man than you, Captain, but a"
GARTH,Fascinating. Your Vulcan friend is a very ingenious fellow. This

KIRK," I'm your Captain, Spock! Can't you tell? Shoot!"
KIRK," He's right, Spock. You must shoot, but shoot both of"
SPOCK,"Captain Kirk, I presume."
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,Spock to Enterprise.

MCCOY,Intravenous is indicated unless circumstances make it

SPOCK,"I am Mister Spock, science officer on a Starship."

GARTH,Starship. Starship.

GARTH,"No, Captain. The medicine seems to be taking effect. I can"
KIRK,"No, Captain. No."
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain."
KIRK,Tell me something. Why was it so impossible to tell the
SPOCK,"It was not impossible, Captain. Our presence here is proof of"
KIRK,"Yes, and congratulations. What took you so long?"
SPOCK,"The interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief, Captain."

KIRK,"Mister Chekov, our estimated time of arrival"
CHEKOV,"At present speed, our eta is three hours, four minutes, sir."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, advise the planet's ministry of health that"
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"Scotty, will that present any problems for you?"
SCOTT,"None, sir. All tanks are being positioned."
SULU,"Captain, sensors indicate a space vehicle of some sort ahead."
KIRK,Is it within visual range?
SULU,"Coming into range now, sir. It's following a very erratic course."
KIRK,"Put it on the screen, extreme magnification."
CHEKOV,I think that may be a Starfleet shuttlecraft.
SPOCK,"That is exactly what it is, Mister Chekov."
SULU,It looks like the one reported stolen from Starbase Four two
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact them on command frequency two."
UHURA,"Aye, Captain. No response, sir."
KIRK,Try all frequencies.
UHURA,"Aye, sir. Hailing on all frequencies."

MCCOY,"Well, I can't give you any specific circumstance that will"
KIRK,"And judging by looking at him, we know at the very least he is"
SPOCK,"There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel to"
MCCOY,"Yes, I would agree. That's the case here."
KIRK,"Your prognosis, Doctor?"
MCCOY,"Well, I can't give you one, Jim. I've never worked on anyone"

SPOCK,"With your permission, Captain, I shall do some further research"
CHAPEL,"He's coming around, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Well, touch and go there for a minute, but you're out of danger"
KIRK,You're aboard the starship Enterprise.
LOKAI,I've heard of it. It's in the United Fleet of Planets?
KIRK,Federation. So was the shuttlecraft that you were flying in.
LOKAI,It was?
KIRK,Don't you usually know whose property you've stolen?
LOKAI,I am not a thief.
KIRK,"Well, certainly no ordinary thief, considering what it is you"
LOKAI,You're being very loose with your accusations and drawing
KIRK,"Well, I do know you made off with a ship that didn't belong to"
LOKAI,I do not make off with things. My need gave me the right to use
KIRK,You can try those technical evasions on Starfleet Command. That's
LOKAI,I'm grateful for your rescue.
KIRK,Don't mention it. We're pleased to have caught you. Who are you?
LOKAI,My name is Lokai.
KIRK,Go on.
LOKAI,From the planet Cheron.
KIRK,"That's in the southernmost part of the galaxy, in an uncharted"
LOKAI,The charge is trifling. I would've returned the ship as soon as
I KIRK,Had what? What were you going to do?
LOKAI,You monotone humans are all alike. First you condemn and then
MCCOY,"Well, however we view him, Captain, he's certainly no ordinary"
KIRK,We've never encountered a being like you. I'd like to know more
LOKAI,I'm very tired.
KIRK,"And very evasive. Or at least not fully responsive. Now, then,"
LOKAI,"I insist, I'm extremely tired. Made so by your vindictive"
KIRK,Lieutenant Uhura.
KIRK,"Notify Starbase Four that we've recovered its shuttlecraft, and"
KIRK,"Bones, if you're satisfied that the mutation theory is"

KIRK,"Maximum magnification. I draw a blank, Mister Spock. Your"
SPOCK,"Negative, Captain."
CHEKOV,"No malfunction, sir. The reading persists."
KIRK,What is it?
SPOCK,"There is a vessel out there, Captain."
KIRK,Could it be a Romulan ship using their cloaking device?
SPOCK,Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel. It is totally
UHURA,"Captain, I've tried all hailing frequencies. Negative, sir."
KIRK,"Weaponry on the vessel, Spock?"
SPOCK,Nothing identifiable. The craft appears to be built for speed
KIRK,Something out there can't be seen. Explanation?
SPOCK,"None. Completely elusive. In fact, it's invisible."
KIRK,Invisible. Malfunction?
SPOCK,There is no sensor failure. The readings persist.
CHEKOV,It's headed straight for us!
KIRK,Evasive action.
CHEKOV,"It shifts with us, sir. And we're pushing to the limit!"
KIRK,"Deflector shields activated, Mister Sulu."
SULU,"Automatic, sir."
CHEKOV,We're on collision course.
SULU,It's out of control or a suicide mission.
KIRK,Sound warning for collision. Red Alert.
SULU,Brace yourself for collision. Brace yourself.
KIRK,"Read out, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,It just disintegrated. Fascinating.
KIRK,What is it now?
SPOCK,"It is gone now, Captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien"
KIRK,Where?
BELE,"Right here, Captain."
KIRK,"Explain, Spock. One of a kind?"
BELE,I am Bele.
KIRK,"Of the planet Cheron, no doubt."
BELE,Forgive my unorthodox arrival.
KIRK,Your mode of travel was also unorthodox. Secure from Red Alert.
BELE,"It served me long and durably. Unfortunately, the strain of"

BELE,Yes. It was sheathed in special materials that rendered it

BELE,I am chief officer of the Commission on Political Traitors. Lokai

BELE,"With your permission, Captain."
KIRK,Mister Spock.
BELE,"Well, Lokai, it's a pleasure to see you"
LOKAI,"I will not return to Cheron with him, to a land of murdering"
KIRK,I told you where you were going. I allowed your fellow countryman

BELE,"They were savages, Captain. We took them into our hearts, our"
LOKAI,"Yes, just education enough to serve the master race."
BELE,You were the product of our love! And you repaid us with murder.
LOKAI,Why should a slave show mercy to the enslaver?
BELE,Slaves? That was changed thousands of years ago. You were freed.
LOKAI,Freed? Were we free to be men? Free to be husbands and fathers?
BELE,"Yes, you were free, if you knew how to use your freedom. You were"
LOKAI,I tried to break the chains of a hundred million people. My only

LOKAI,I know you and all those with whom you're plotting to take power
KIRK,"It's now very clear you know each other extremely well,"
LOKAI,"Captain, I led revolutionaries, not criminals. I demand"
KIRK,"I'll tell you once more. For you, this ship is a prison."
BELE,"Captain, it is imperative that you return Lokai to Cheron for"
KIRK,"Commissioner, Cheron is not a member of the Federation. No"
BELE,"Captain, I hope you will be sensible."
KIRK,How do you mean?
BELE,Co-operation.
KIRK,I cannot take sides.
BELE,"Since I am without a vessel to return to Cheron, I insist that"
KIRK,Impossible. I have a mission to accomplish. There's a planet to
BELE,"I am sorry, Captain. That will not be satisfactory, not at all"
KIRK,"Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary from a far planet, I offer"
BELE,You're the captain.
KIRK,"Yes, I am. I think we can consider your problem settled. At least"
KIRK,"And I suggest you get a great deal of rest, especially your vocal"
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,"Well, get back on course."
KIRK,I'll be right there.
KIRK,Have you located the malfunction?
SULU,"No, sir. The ship is unresponsive. We're moving away from"
KIRK,"Explanation, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Elusive, Captain. I am investigating."
SULU,I can't understand it. I simply have no control.
KIRK,Kirk to engineering.
KIRK,"Scotty, we're suddenly off course. Check our manoeuvering"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. Hold. Captain, no malfunction"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. Out.  Engineer to bridge."
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,"Stand by for check. Scotty, we're still off course."
KIRK,"Speed, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,We're moving at warp eight.
KIRK,And new course?
CHEKOV,four oh three mark seven. Straight for the Coal Sack if there
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, put the ship on Red Alert. All hands, this is"
KIRK,"Our new heading, Mister Chekov?"
CHEKOV,Four oh three mark seven.
KIRK,Spock?
SPOCK,"Confirmed, Captain. Holding pattern. Co-ordinates now indicate"
BELE,"We're on the way to Cheron. Captain, this ship is now under my"
SCOTT,"Captain, we are now at warp ten and the speed is increasing!"
SPOCK,"Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all"
LOKAI,"I will not return to Cheron. Captain, you must guarantee me"
BELE,"He cannot help you now. You are lost, Lokai. You're on the way to"
LOKAI,Stop him.
BELE,You evil mound of filth. Not this time.
LOKAI,My cause is just. You must help me. All of you must help me.
BELE,"Oh, the old cry. Pity me, pity me. Everywhere he's gone, he's"
LOKAI,Kill him. Kill him!
KIRK,You're two of a kind.
BELE,And we are both going to Cheron. You cannot change the course of
KIRK,"Security, put them both in the brig."
KIRK,Phasers on stun. Fire. 
BELE,Your phasers are ineffective against our shields. You are
LOKAI,"What a fool I am, expecting help from someone like you."
KIRK,This ship is going to Ariannus.
BELE,"No, this ship is going to Cheron. I will let nothing interfere."
KIRK,We are going to Ariannus. The lives of a billion people make no
BELE,"You are being obtuse, Captain. I am permitting no choice. My will"
KIRK,"Bele, I am captain of this ship, and it will follow whatever"
BELE,You're bluffing.
KIRK,I will destroy it.
BELE,You can no more destroy this ship than I can change colour.
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, tie in the bridge to the master computer."
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Computer, destruct sequence. Are you ready to copy?"
COMPUTER,Working.
KIRK,"Prepare to verify destruct sequence code one. Computer, this is"
KIRK,Mister Spock.
SPOCK,"This is Commander Spock, science officer. Destruct sequence"
COMPUTER,Voice and code verified and correct. Sequence two complete.
KIRK,Mister Scott.
SCOTT,"This is Lieutenant Commander Scott, chief engineering officer of"
COMPUTER,"Voice and code one B, two B, three verified and correct."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, has the ship returned to the course set for it by"

COMPUTER,"Thirty seconds. twenty nine, twenty eight, twenty seven,"
KIRK,Let's see you prevent the computer from fulfilling my commands.
COMPUTER,"Twenty seconds,"
KIRK,"From five to zero, no command in the universe can prevent the"
COMPUTER,"Fifteen seconds,"
KIRK,You can use your will to drag this ship to Cheron. But I command
COMPUTER,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,"
BELE,I agree!
KIRK,Computer. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Code
COMPUTER,Destruct order aborted. Destruct order aborted.
KIRK,"Mister Spock, is this ship headed for Ariannus?"
SPOCK,"Negative, Captain. The Enterprise is now moving in a circular"
SCOTT,"And at warp ten, we're going now here mighty fast."
LOKAI,I warned you of his treachery. Kill him!
KIRK,"We're waiting for you to fulfil your commitment, Commissioner."
BELE,"Captain, I am happy to have you complete your mission of mercy to"
KIRK,"I make no deals for control of this ship, sir."
BELE,The ship's course is now in your control.
KIRK,Ship's course?
SPOCK,"Enterprise is now on course to Ariannus, Captain."
KIRK,"Speed, Scotty?"
SCOTT,"Warp six and smoothly operating, sir."
KIRK,"Good. Lieutenant Uhura, cancel Red Alert."
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Let me reaffirm my position, gentlemen. I could put you in the"
LOKAI,"You speak very well, Captain. Your words promise justice for"
KIRK,"We try, sir."
LOKAI,"Yes, well, I have learned to wait for actions. After Ariannus,"
SPOCK,Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids.
SCOTT,Disgusting is what I call them.
SPOCK,That description is not scientifically accurate.
SCOTT,"Mister Spock, the word disgusting describes exactly what I feel"
KIRK,That's enough for today. Those two are beginning to affect you.
LOKAI,And I know from my actions you must all think me a volcanic
SULU,"No one knows how he'll react under pressure, Lokai."
CHEKOV,"After all, we are only human."
LOKAI,"Ah, Mister Chekov, therein lies my lack of ability to alert you"
CHEKOV,There was persecution on Earth once. I remember reading about
SULU,"Yes, but it happened way back in the twentieth century. There's"
LOKAI,"You have read about it in history, I see. How can I make your"
BELE,Putting the matter into the hands of your
KIRK,I expect the answer is already on its way.
BELE,"Well, then, let us drink to their wise solution to our problem."
KIRK,Let's do that.
SPOCK,"Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution"
BELE,"Gentlemen, we are discussing a question of degree. Surely,"
SPOCK,We do not know that Lokai has done that.
BELE,One thing we are agreed on is that Lokai is a criminal.
KIRK,"No, Commissioner. The one thing we're agreed upon is that Lokai"
KIRK,Excuse me.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,"Yes, read it."
UHURA,Starfleet Command extends greetings to
Commissioner Bele will be permitted to retain his prisoner and beprovided transportation KIRK,That's enough. Thank you.
BELE,"As always, Lokai has managed to gain allies."
KIRK,"Now, wait a minute, Commissioner,"
BELE,"Even if they don't recognise themselves as being such. Yes, he"
KIRK,"I can assure you, Commissioner, that our minds will not be"
BELE,It is obvious to the most simpleminded that Lokai is of an
SPOCK,"The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the"
BELE,"Are you blind, Commander Spock? Well, look at me. Look at me!"
KIRK,You're black on one side and white on the other.
BELE,I am black on the right side.
KIRK,I fail to see the significant difference.
BELE,Lokai is white on the right side. All of his people are white on
SPOCK,"Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may"
BELE,"Commander Spock, I am delighted that Vulcan was saved, but you"
KIRK,"Let Lokai state his grievances. Hear him, listen to him. Maybe he"
BELE,He cannot change.
SPOCK,"Change is the essential process of all existence. For instance,"
BELE,You mean like both of you?
KIRK,"There must have been a time, long ago no doubt, when that was"
KIRK,Excuse me. Kirk here.
KIRK,Very good. Commence decontamination procedures when ready. Advise
BELE,I once heard that on some of your planets people believe they are
SPOCK,The actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower
SCOTT,Ready for decontamination procedure.
CHEKOV,"Ready, sir."
SULU,Ready here.
UHURA,"Ready, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,"Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates requested by Ariannus."
SULU,"Locked in, sir."
SCOTT,"Mister Chekov, position tanks for spray release."
CHEKOV,Tanks positioned.
SCOTT,"Lieutenant Uhura, advise Ariannus the mission is to begin on"
UHURA,Ariannus says go ahead.
SCOTT,"Well, let 'er rip."
SCOTT,Scott to Captain Kirk.
SCOTT,"First run complete, sir."
KIRK,Good. Repeat procedure for maximum effect.
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. Ready to repeat decontamination"
CHEKOV,"Ready, sir."
SCOTT,Mister Sulu?
SULU,Ready here.
SCOTT,"We're completing the final orbit of Ariannus, sir. I'm awaiting"
KIRK,Very good. We'll be right up.
KIRK,Set directional controls for Starbase Four.
BELE,There is nothing I would like more.
SPOCK,"Trouble, Mister Chekov?"
CHEKOV,"I don't rightly know, Mister Spock. I was trying to programme"
UHURA,"It just seemed to go dead, sir."
SPOCK,"Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned"
KIRK,Can you determine which ones?
BELE,"The directional control and the self-destruct, Captain, are both"
BELE,Now can we go to Cheron without any more discussion?
KIRK,"At the moment, I seem to have no choice."
LOKAI,So this is justice after Ariannus! You have signed my death
CHEKOV,We are not killers.
LOKAI,"What do you do, carry justice on your tongues? You will beg for"
KIRK,"After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much"
SPOCK,I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers.
BELE,"You're finished, Lokai! We've got your kind penned in on Cheron"
LOKAI,"You useless pieces of bland flesh. I'll take you with me, you"
KIRK,"Bele, you keep this up, and you'll never get to Cheron with your"
KIRK,"And you, Lokai, will die here in space. You'll inspire no more"
LOKAI,"Remember, Captain, political sanctuary is my right. I am your"
KIRK,You've made your point.
BELE,"If you listen to his legalistic trickery, I shall have to destroy"
KIRK,I understand. Will you return the Enterprise to my control?
BELE,Why not?
KIRK,"Scotty, have repairs on directional control been completed?"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. Re-routed."
KIRK,Check controls and co-ordinates.
SULU,Controls operating. The Enterprise is responding as always.
CHEKOV,Locking onto co-ordinates.
SPOCK,"Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron."
KIRK,Is it within visual range?
SPOCK,"Coming within visual range now, Captain."
KIRK,"Chekov, put it on the screen. Extreme magnification. What are you"
SPOCK,"Several large cities, uninhabited. Extensive traffic systems,"
KIRK,"You mean, all the people are dead?"
SPOCK,"All dead, Captain. They have annihilated each other totally."
BELE,"My people, all dead?"
KIRK,"Yes, Commissioner, all of them."
LOKAI,No one alive?
SPOCK,"None at all, sir."
BELE,Your band of murderers did this.
LOKAI,Your genocidal maniacs did this!
KIRK,Stop it! What's the matter with you two? Didn't you hear Spock?
LOKAI,You're an idealistic dreamer.
KIRK,Bele. The chase is finished.
BELE,He must not escape me.
SPOCK,Where can he go?
KIRK,Bele.
UHURA,"Shall I alert security, sir?"
KIRK,"No, Lieutenant. Where can they run?"
SPOCK,"Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors. Bele is chasing"
UHURA,"Captain, someone has activated the transporter mechanism."
KIRK,"Spock, anyone in the transporter room?"
SPOCK,"Negative, Captain. Transporter room is clear. However, there is"
KIRK,There's nobody there to try him. His judges are all dead.
UHURA,"Captain, the transporter mechanism has been activated again."
KIRK,Of course.
SPOCK,"It is Bele, Captain. And another life-form has appeared on"
UHURA,It doesn't make any sense.
SPOCK,To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints
SULU,But their planet's dead. Does it matter now which one's right?
SPOCK,Not to Lokai and Bele. All that matters to them is their hate.
UHURA,"Do you suppose that's all they ever had, sir?"
KIRK,"No, but that's all they have left. Warp factor two, Mister Sulu."
Original Airdate,"17 Jan, 1969"
SPOCK,"I shall be interested in hearing your description, Captain."
KIRK,You won't have long to wait.
SPOCK,Lieutenant Uhura.
UHURA,"Yes, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Do we have final clearance from Gideon?
UHURA,"Yes, Mister Spock. They have provided us"
SPOCK,"May I have them, please?"
SPOCK,Eight seven five.
SPOCK,Zero two zero.
SPOCK,Zero seven nine.
KIRK,"Let's go, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Energising.
KIRK,Mister Spock?  Mister Spock. I have not yet
KIRK,Engineering?
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, report immediately. All"
KIRK,Sickbay? Doctor McCoy?
KIRK,"Bones? Bones, answer me."
KIRK,Bones. Still orbiting Gideon.
UHURA,"Gideon is contacting us, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Put it on the screen.
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,"This is Mister Spock, Ambassador Hodin. Captain Kirk was"
SPOCK,I transported him myself.
SPOCK,He was beamed directly to your council chambers. Please verify
CHEKOV,Co-ordinates confirmed.
SPOCK,"I am not questioning that, sir."
HODIN,"If he is not here, that is your own"
SPOCK,"I do not deny that, sir. I am not attempting"
SPOCK,"Your Excellency, even with intricate machinery as delicately"
HODIN,Let us hope it was on dry land.
SPOCK,Your Excellency. May I cut right to the heart of the matter? I
HODIN,Permission denied.
HODIN,Of our jealous tradition of isolation from
SPOCK,"Your Excellency, the wars between opposing star systems no"
SPOCK,We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of
MCCOY,"Well, what are we waiting for, Mister Spock? We're not"
SPOCK,"We are representatives of the Federation, Doctor."
MCCOY,That doesn't mean we have behave like children and listen to
SPOCK,"Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only channel available to us at"
CHEKOV,We should never have agreed to such restrictions.
SPOCK,"We did not, Mister Chekov. The Federation did. Lieutenant Uhura."
UHURA,"Yes, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,Contact Starfleet immediately. Explain our problem. Request
UHURA,"At once, sir."
CHEKOV,Are there any other possibilities?
SPOCK,"There are endless, Mister Chekov."
MCCOY,"Well, where do we start, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"Institute a sensor scan three hundred and sixty degrees, one"
MCCOY,You mean you're going to scan space for him?
SULU,"But, sir, that could take years."
SPOCK,"Then the sooner you begin, the better."
SULU,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,Who are you?
ODONA,"Odona. Yes, my name is Odona. Why did you bring me here?"
KIRK,What are you doing on my ship?
ODONA,Is this entire ship yours?
KIRK,"Not my personal property, but I'm the captain."
ODONA,And you have it all to yourself?
KIRK,"It seems, at the moment, we have it all to ourselves."
ODONA,"You're hurting me, Captain"
KIRK,Kirk. I'm sorry. James Kirk. And I didn't bring you here.
ODONA,If you didn't bring me
KIRK,That's right. Who has brought you here?
ODONA,I don't know.
KIRK,You? What happened before you came here? Try to remember. It's
ODONA,"It seems I was standing in a, yes. I was standing in a large"
KIRK,Don't be afraid.
ODONA,"I'm not, but you are troubled."
KIRK,I seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the
ODONA,I'm sorry. I wish I could help.
KIRK,"Maybe you can. Tell me the rest. You were fighting for oxygen,"
ODONA,"And then I, suddenly I was here on this, on your ship. And there"
KIRK,How long have you been aboard the Enterprise?
ODONA,I don't know. Not long. Is it important?
KIRK,It might be. Come with me.
SPOCK,"Lieutenant Uhura, has Starfleet honoured our"
UHURA,"There has been no response as yet, sir."
SPOCK,Did you advise them the captain's life is at stake?
UHURA,"Yes, sir. They insist that the matter must be referred to the"
SPOCK,What department?
UHURA,Bureau of Planetary Treaties.
SPOCK,Contact them directly.
UHURA,"I did, Mister Spock. They insist that we must go through"
SULU,"With the captain lost, sir, that's the best they could come up"
SPOCK,"Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently, but they"
KIRK,Nine minutes of my life has been lost.
ODONA,I don't understand.
KIRK,Between the time I tried to beam down to Gideon and the time I
ODONA,What is Gideon?
KIRK,That's your home. The planet that you come from.
ODONA,Is it?
KIRK,It must be.
ODONA,Gideon? I don't know any Gideon.
KIRK,That's impossible. We were in synchronous orbit over the capital
ODONA,I do not think so.
KIRK,We're no longer over Gideon.
ODONA,Where are we?
KIRK,"I don't know. I'm not familiar with that quadrant. Odona, you"
ODONA,"Captain, before I said I wasn't afraid. Now I am."
UHURA,"The ambassador will speak, sir. They're"
HODIN,"Good news. Very good news indeed, Mister"
HODIN,You requested a most thorough search. It is in the record. And
HODIN,"Surely, Mister Spock, you do not intend, I hope, to create a"
HODIN,"Mister Spock, you're an officer of a spaceship. In your"
SPOCK,"True, Your Excellency."
HODIN,It is of the utmost importance that the
SPOCK,"Your Excellency, I am basically a scientist."
HODIN,I'm glad to hear it. Perhaps you could then
MCCOY,Are you going to let him get away with that?
SCOTT,"No matter what you say, Mister Spock, he'll twist your meaning."
UHURA,"Yes, he's infuriating, sir. How can you stand it?"
MCCOY,We do not leave without being absolutely sure ourselves that
HODIN,Mister Spock! Mister Spock!
SPOCK,"Yes, Your Excellency."
HODIN,Are you still there?
SPOCK,"Yes, Your Excellency."
HODIN,There was considerable interference with
SPOCK,"I apologise for the noise, your Excellency. To summarise, I"
HODIN,"Forgive me, Mister Spock. No criticism of"
HODIN,Repeat this disaster with another officer?
SCOTT,"I'll not take that, Mister Spock. That"
SPOCK,"Mister Scott, you'll go to the transporter room and await my"
SCOTT,"Aye, Mister Spock."
HODIN,Would you be so good as to repeat what you
SPOCK,"Yes, Your Excellency. The ship's engineer"
HODIN,"But, Mister Spock, you"
SPOCK,"Your Excellency, grant this one request."
HODIN,"You are a very persistent fellow, Mister"
HODIN,There is one proviso. We cannot risk further
SPOCK,"Thank you, Your Excellency. Your proposal is"
SPOCK,Prepare to beam aboard a representative of the Gideon council.
SCOTT,"Aye, aye, sir."
HODIN,My assistant will provide you with the
HODIN,"Thank you. Proceed, Krodak."
KRODAK, Eight seven five.
KRODAK,Zero two zero.
SCOTT,Seven zero nine. Energising.
SCOTT,"Mister Spock, the gentleman from Gideon is here."
SPOCK,"Your Excellency, your assistant has arrived"
SPOCK,"Sir, our captain is still missing, and I now demand that I be"
SPOCK,"Mister Scott, beam down the gentleman from Gideon."
MCCOY,Just when I was beginning to think you might find a whole new
SPOCK,"Do not give up hope. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet"
UHURA,"Yes, Mister Spock. Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Enterprise"
KIRK,Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Enterprise
ODONA,Isn't it in working order?
KIRK,It seems to be.
ODONA,Then someone should have heard you.
KIRK,Captain Kirk here. Please answer red priority. Please answer red
ODONA,Why should they do that?
KIRK,They wouldn't.
ODONA,What did you do?
KIRK,Took the ship out of warp speed.
ODONA,Out of what?
KIRK,Space terminology. We're no longer moving faster than the speed
ODONA,It feels the same.
KIRK,Of course it does. Maybe it is the same.
ODONA,"Well, has the ship slowed down?"
KIRK," If you believe that, we have."
ODONA,"Oh, please! Don't tell me the sky is out of order now. It's so"
KIRK,"It isn't really, you know."
ODONA,And it's beautiful.
KIRK,"Yes. Yes, it is. Very, very beautiful."
ODONA,"And we're alone. Can you make it last a long, long time?"
KIRK,How long would you like it to last?
ODONA,Forever.
KIRK,"Well, let's see. Power, that's no problem, it regenerates. And"
So that should last us ODONA,Forever. All my life I've dreamed of being alone.
KIRK,Most people are afraid of being alone.
ODONA,"Where I come from, people dream of it."
KIRK,Why? Why are the people of Gideon like that?
ODONA,"Gideon? I told you, I don't know where I come from, what my"
KIRK,It might be Gideon.
ODONA,Does it matter so much?
KIRK,Yes. It might help me pinpoint our location.
ODONA,"And then you might find your crew. Being here with you, I forgot"
KIRK,I've got to contact whoever is manipulating us. There must be a
ODONA,Because they never can be.
KIRK,Why? What makes it so impossible to be alone?
ODONA,"Because there are so many of us. So many. There is no place, no"
KIRK,Who sent you here?
ODONA,No one commands Odona. I was not sent here.
KIRK,"You've come to kill. Odona, have you come to die?"
ODONA,I don't know. I don't care. I only know I'm here. I only know
KIRK,"Now, all I have to do is find a medical kit,"
ODONA,Cure?
KIRK,"Yes, the irritation would be gone."
ODONA,What will happen if you do not find one? Will you become sick
KIRK,"No. Over something as simple as this? No, it'll cure itself"
ODONA,"Yes, it sounds like an engine."
KIRK,"No, the ship's engines don't make that kind of sound."
ODONA,But there is something wrong with the equipment. Could that be
KIRK,I know every sound that this ship might make. That's coming from
ODONA,A storm might
KIRK,"A storm might, but you wouldn't be able to hear it. Come on."
KIRK,This is a viewing port. We'll be able to see
KIRK,If it works.
ODONA,People. The faces of people. And then the stars. What's
KIRK,"It was like the heartbeat of all those people, and thousands upon"
ODONA,But you said we were moving through space.
KIRK,"Yes, I said that."
ODONA,Then the people can't be out there.
KIRK,"Yes, they can."
ODONA,Please don't frighten me.
KIRK,It could be a mirage. They could exist in our minds.
ODONA,You mean that we're going mad.
KIRK,Or some power is creating the illusion in our minds that we are
ODONA,I don't know. I don't know.
KIRK,I think I have an idea. So that we won't keep trying to find out
ODONA,"Oh, be content!"
KIRK,Be content? Be content? Not until I find out what happened to my
ODONA,I don't know.
KIRK,Did you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself?
ODONA,Captain.
KIRK,Hodin.
HODIN,"Yes, Captain Kirk. Our experiment has passed the first stage."
KIRK,Let me in there. I can help her.
HODIN,We have no need of any of your medicines.
KIRK,But she's ill.
HODIN,"And we're grateful to you for her illness. You have done well,"
HODIN,Guard the captain well. We shall need him for a long time.
SPOCK,"Admiral, the crew will not understand it."
SPOCK,We wish only to save the life of the captain.
SPOCK,"I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, Admiral. I"
SPOCK,"I now know where the captain is being held, if he is being held"
SPOCK,"Sir, the captain is not being held in the Gideon council"
SPOCK,"Since the planet is shielded from our sensors, we cannot"
SPOCK,"Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is"
ODONA,Will it last long?
HODIN,That depends on the strength of the one infected. You have great
ODONA,How will you know when I am to die?
HODIN,"Your body temperature will be very great. You will see us, but"
ODONA,"I must see him before then, Father."
HODIN,Rest. Now lie still. Do you feel great pain?
ODONA,"Yes, in my arms and thighs."
HODIN,What is it like to feel pain?
ODONA,"It is like, like when you see the people have no hope for"
HODIN,Your courage gives me great pride.
KIRK,Let me see her.
HODIN,Not yet.
KIRK,You don't know what she may have.
HODIN,But we do. She has Vegan choriomeningitis.
KIRK,"It's very rare, and always fatal if not treated within twenty"
HODIN,Yes. Our prime minister learned about you during our
KIRK,That's how my arm got hurt.
HODIN,"Yes. As Odona told you, we have no need for medical"
KIRK,You're mad.
HODIN,No. We are desperate.
MCCOY,I don't understand how Starfleet can deny
SPOCK,"They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor."
SCOTT,I don't see how they expect us to sit here and wait for the
SPOCK,"Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet."
MCCOY,"That's the best possible decision you could make, Spock. I'm"
SPOCK,"I do not make it lightly, Doctor. However, Command knows that"
UHURA,"Eight seven five, zero two zero, zero seven nine."
SPOCK,"Mister Scott, the co-ordinates given you?"
SCOTT,"Eight seven five, zero two zero, seven zero nine."
MCCOY,Co-ordinates don't match.
SPOCK,"Precisely. I shall beam down at once. Mister Scott, you have the"
MCCOY,I'll pick up my medical tricorder and meet you in the
SPOCK,"Negative, Doctor. I cannot accept the responsibility for"
MCCOY,I'm not asking you to make the decision for me.
SPOCK,"The situation forces me to do so, Doctor."
MCCOY,"In that case, it's the worst possible decision you can make,"
SPOCK,This will not take long.
SCOTT,Isn't that just about what Captain Kirk said before he left?
SPOCK, Captain Kirk. Spock here.
KIRK,Your report to the Federation was a tissue of
HODIN,"And so it was! A long, long time ago what we described was true!"
KIRK,Those are conditions most people would envy.
HODIN,But Gideon did not find it enviable. The birth rate continued to
KIRK,Then why haven't you introduced any of the new techniques to
HODIN,Every organ renews itself. It would be impossible.
KIRK,Then let your people learn about the devices to safely prevent
HODIN,"But you see, the people of Gideon have always believed that life"
KIRK,And the great misery which you now face.
HODIN,"That is bitterly true, Captain. Nevertheless, we cannot deny the"
KIRK,Yet you can kill a young girl.
HODIN,We're trying to re-adjust the life cycle of an entire

HODIN,My daughter hoped to make you feel the agony of Gideon. But it

HODIN,You will stay. Your blood will provide it.
KIRK,"No sir, not me. You have many methods available. I've mentioned"
HODIN,My daughter pleaded with you to stay.
KIRK,What was said and what happened between us was for us alone.
HODIN,She hoped you would love her and wish to stay.
KIRK,So that was your plan. That I would fall so under her spell that
HODIN,Stay with us. We're desperate.
KRODAK,Odona's fever is rising. She's calling the name of James Kirk.

MCCOY,"Well, that was close, but you made it."
ODONA,I am cured?
MCCOY,Right. Just like the captain.
ODONA,"Instead of smiling at me, you should be shouting in anger."
KIRK,"Why, because you're well again?"
ODONA,No. Because I pretended to be  How can you bear to look
KIRK,At least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you.
ODONA,"You are a gentleman, Captain Kirk."
KIRK,"Thank you, ma'am."
ODONA,You are no longer needed on Gideon. I can take your place there.
KIRK,Is that what you want to do?
ODONA,That is what I must do. I am needed there now.
KIRK,"You're needed everywhere, Odona."
ODONA,It is not like our ship.
KIRK,"Oh, yes, it is. It's exactly the same. Only this one works."
ODONA,It goes to many other planets?
KIRK,"Yes, it goes to the whole galaxy. With another difference. This"
ODONA,It seems crowded to you?

KIRK,Let's take the facts one by one. That should explain something.
SPOCK,Undoubtedly. The age of this planet would seem to be only a few
KIRK,Its size is approximately that of Earth's moon.
SPOCK,But its mass and atmosphere are similar to Earth.
KIRK,That would be difficult to explain.
SPOCK,"It would be impossible, Captain. An atmosphere could not evolve"
KIRK,And yet it has.
SPOCK,Evidently. But the inconsistencies are so compounded as to

SPOCK,"Precisely, Captain."

KIRK,This expedition should be a geologist's
AMATO,The opportunity to explore so young a planet is an incredible
KIRK,"Yes. If Mister Spock is correct, you'll have a report to startle"
MCCOY,"Why? What is it, Jim?"
KIRK,A planet that even Spock can't explain. Prepare to transport.
LOSIRA,Wait! You must not go!
MCCOY,"Jim, did you see what I saw?"
KIRK,That woman attacked Ensign Wyatt.
AMATO,Captain. Captain!
UHURA,Mister Spock! Are you all right?
SPOCK,Yes. I believe no permanent damage was done.
UHURA,What happened?
SPOCK,The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the
UHURA,"No, Mister Spock. I meant what happened to us?"
SPOCK,That we have yet to ascertain.
RAHDA, Mister Spock. The planet's gone!
SULU,What kind of earthquakes do they have in this
KIRK,I don't know. Any more like that and they'll tear this planet
AMATO,"Captain, this tremor we felt, if that's what it was, it's"
KIRK,Could seismic stress have accounted for it?
AMATO,The reading I got had nothing to do with a seismic force.
KIRK,That's very strange. And that woman. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to
SULU,"It's gone! The Enterprise, it's gone!"
AMATO,"He's right, Captain. There's nothing there."
MCCOY,"How could it be gone? What the devil does that mean, Jim?"

SCOTT,But that's not possible. Nothing can do that.
SPOCK,"Mister Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only"

SPOCK,"In that case, Mister Scott, I suggest we start at once. Can you"
SCOTT,"Aye, sir. And maybe a wee bit more. I'll sit on the warp engines"
SPOCK,"That position, Mister Scott, would not only be unavailing but"
RAHDA,"Already plotted and laid in, sir."
SPOCK,Good. Then prepare to come to warp eight.
KIRK,Your report covers all vegetation?

MCCOY,I'll be right there.
KIRK,Bones!
MCCOY,"Jim, every cell in his body's been disrupted."
MCCOY,"Jim, what are you doing?"
KIRK,Digging a grave.
SULU,Poor D'Amato. What a terrible way to die.
KIRK,"There are no good ways, Sulu."
SULU,That's the same red rock.
KIRK,My phaser didn't cut through it.
MCCOY,"Whatever it is, it has a mighty high melting point."
KIRK,"Eight thousand degrees centigrade. It looks like igneous rock,"
MCCOY,"This whole planet must be made up of this substance, covered"
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, it might explain this place a little better if we"
SULU,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,"Well, I guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for"
KIRK,Yeah. It might be the most suitable memorial at that.

SPOCK,"That is obvious, Mister Scott. I suggest you avoid emotionalism"
SULU,It looks so lonely there.
MCCOY,It would be worse if he had company.
SULU,"Doctor, how can you joke about it?"
MCCOY,"I'm not joking. Until we know what killed him, none of us are"

LOSIRA,"My name is not important. Yours is Watkins, John B. Engineer"
WATKINS,You know all about me. I've never seen you before.
LOSIRA,Show me this unit. I wish to learn.

LOSIRA,That is not important. You are Lieutenant Sulu. You were born
SULU,How do you know this? Where did you get this information? Are you
LOSIRA,I am from here.
SULU,Then the planet is hollow. Who killed Lieutenant D'Amato? All

SULU,You were on the Enterprise. Keep back! Stop or I'll shoot! I
SULU,Captain Kirk! Captain Kirk!
KIRK,Hold it! Who are you?
LOSIRA,I am for him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu.
SULU,"Don't let her touch you, Captain! That's how D'Amato died."
LOSIRA,"I am for Lieutenant Sulu. Please, I must touch him."
KIRK,How can you destroy others and not me?
LOSIRA,I don't want to destroy. I don't want to.
KIRK,Who are you? Why are you trying to kill us?
LOSIRA,Only Sulu. I mean you no harm.
KIRK,Are there men on this planet?
LOSIRA,"Please, I must touch him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu."
KIRK,No!

KIRK,The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure. Sulu's
MCCOY,Yes. Why didn't she kill you?
KIRK,She's not through yet.
SCOTT,It's useless. And there's no question it's deliberate.
SPOCK,Sabotage.
SCOTT,"Aye, and a thorough job. The system's foolproof. Whoever"

CHAPEL,"Everything appears normal, Doctor."
MCCOY,Thank you.
MIRA,"What's that you're doing, Nurse?"
CHAPEL,Recording your responses in this computer.
MIRA,But why? I haven't had a single response worth noting.
CHAPEL,"Lieutenant, please."
MIRA,"Well, have l?"
MCCOY,"Lieutenant, there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this"
MIRA,"I want to know why too. You're the doctor, you tell me. This is a"
MCCOY,This whole thing is a new experience for all of us.
MIRA,All of you are accustomed to new experiences. It's part of your

MCCOY,"Well, if we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that"
MIRA,Nothing.
MCCOY,Nothing?
MIRA,Absolutely nothing.
MCCOY,Lieutenant
MIRA,"Doctor, there is nothing more I can tell you."
MCCOY,"Lieutenant, you're being completely unco-operative!"
MIRA,Are you putting that into my record? It's not true.
MCCOY,"I'll put the facts into your record, if I can get them."
SCOTT,"Come on now, Mira. We must help the doctor. Tell us what"
MCCOY,Perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in
SCOTT,I'm sure that's what the lieutenant wants. She just didn't
CHAPEL,"With a bedside manner like that, Scotty, you're in the wrong"
MIRA,"When the record of this is forwarded, I'll be sent back, won't I."
SCOTT,"Oh, you will not! That's ridiculous. This getting used to space"
MIRA,Did you?
SCOTT,"Well, me, that's different. I was practically born to it."
MIRA,I want to continue.
SCOTT,You will. You passed your Starfleet preliminary examinations.
MIRA,I hope that's all it is.
SULU,"Captain, I've plotted the storm's path."
KIRK,Main screen projection.
SULU,"On its present course, it will hit Memory Alpha planetoid as it"
KIRK,"Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that"
CHEKOV,"I cannot, sir. It has the ability to change speed."
UHURA,"Sir, I'm unable to establish contact with the planetoid. I'm"
SPOCK,"It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no"
KIRK,No shields?
SPOCK,"None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding"
KIRK,Wonderful. I hope the storm is aware of that rationale.
CHEKOV,Completing approach to planetoid.
SULU,"It is already over Memory Alpha, Captain! Its speed is"
KIRK,"Are we within orbit range, Mister Chekov?"
CHEKOV,Making final approach.
KIRK,"Lieutenant, try and warn them of"
UHURA,"I'm sorry, sir. I can't break through this interference."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha?"
SPOCK,"It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and"
CHEKOV,"Captain, we are within orbit range."
KIRK,Lock into orbit.
CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
SULU,"It is leaving Memory Alpha, Captain."
SPOCK,"Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha,"
KIRK,Any life readings?
SPOCK,None.
KIRK,Let's find out what's going on down there. Kirk to Engineering.
UHURA,"Aye, aye, sir."
KIRK,"Scotty, where've you been? Where are you?"
SCOTT,In the Sickbay.
KIRK,Are you sick?
SCOTT,"Och, no. I was just checking on the lass."
KIRK,"Well, I'm relieved to hear your prognosis,"
MCCOY,"McCoy here, Jim."
MCCOY,I think she's in good shape.
MCCOY,"Somehow, I find transporting into the"
KIRK,"Scotty, can you get us some more light?"
SCOTT,"I'm afraid this light'll have to do, Captain. The generator is"
KIRK,"Damage report, Spock."
SPOCK,"A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is"
SCOTT,Captain!
SPOCK,"A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain."
KIRK,Locate him and keep him alive. We need more information about
MCCOY,"Over here, Captain!"
KIRK,"Bones, can you do something?"
MCCOY,"Not a thing, Jim.  The same garbled"
KIRK,Are you sure?
MCCOY,Absolutely sure.
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,Beam down Lieutenant Romaine immediately.
KIRK,"Spock, have you seen anything like that before?"
SPOCK,Negative.
KIRK,Bones?
MCCOY,She's dead.
KIRK,What did she die of?
MCCOY,Severe brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural
SPOCK,The attack was thorough.
KIRK,What did the others die of?
MCCOY,"Each had a different centre of brain destroyed, cause unknown."
KIRK,"A different centre of the brain, you say?"
MCCOY,"Yes, Captain. I can be more detailed when we return to the ship"
SCOTT,Mira! The captain has some questions.
MIRA,"Yes, Captain."
KIRK,"Lieutenant, when you were unconscious, you were speaking."
MIRA,What did I say?
KIRK,I don't know. The words were unfamiliar to me.
MIRA,What did it sound like?
KIRK,They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the
MIRA,What technician?
MCCOY,We found one person in there just barely alive. The rest were
KIRK,Lieutenant. Lieutenant.
MIRA,We must get back to the ship!
KIRK,Why? Tell me why.
MIRA,"That storm, it's returning."
KIRK,How do you know?
MIRA,I know. You'll be killed if we stay.
SPOCK,"Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed"
MIRA,I tell you t will kill us.
SULU,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,What's its course?
KIRK,Beam us up.
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, this is the captain. Get the Enterprise out of here."
SCOTT,"Wait, Captain. We've lost Mira."
KIRK,"Delay that order, Mister Sulu!"
SCOTT,Stabilise her!
KYLE,Something's interfering with the transporter signal. I have her
SCOTT,Let me.
KIRK,"All right, Mister Sulu, get us out of here. Mister Scott, check"
SULU,"Captain, it's changing course."
KIRK,"Plot the new course, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,Present course is one two six mark twenty.
KIRK,Plot it.
KIRK,"Mister Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a"
SPOCK,No known conditions in space would support that type of natural
KIRK,What is it?
SPOCK,I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be
KIRK,Then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted.
SPOCK,Ship's sensors are operating at the moment. Perhaps the elusive
MIRA,"I saw those men dead, in their exact"
SCOTT,Listen to me. I've told you what strange tricks a space trip can
MIRA,"No, Scotty."
SCOTT,Have you ever had visions of the future events before this?
MIRA,Never.
SCOTT,"Well, if you ask me, nobody ever has. That seeing to the future,"
MIRA,I've always believed it.
SCOTT,And you were perfectly right.
MIRA,"Then what is it, Scotty? What's frightening me? Ever since that"
SCOTT,"Space. Space, that's all it is."
MIRA,Then I don't have to report it?
SCOTT,"Well, if you want to spend the rest of the trip in Sickbay. But"
SULU,"Captain, it's heading straight for us."
KIRK,Activate shields.
SULU,Shields activated.
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, change course to one four three mark three."
CHEKOV,One four three mark three.
KIRK,"Storm's course, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,One four three mark three.
KIRK,Take evasive action.
SULU,Evasive action.
KIRK,"Hard starboard, two one seven mark five."
SULU,"Two one seven mark five. Still with us, sir."
KIRK,"Hard port, one one seven mark two."
SULU,"One one seven mark two. Still with us, sir!"
KIRK,Is it closing?
SPOCK,"Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance. However, it is"
KIRK,"Your analysis, Spock. What is it?"
SPOCK,"Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct"
KIRK,Who are they? Where are they from?
SPOCK,Impossible to determine without programming for computer
KIRK,It's clear we can't outrun them. Can we shield against them?
SPOCK,I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective
KIRK,There must be some defence we can use.
SPOCK,"Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units. Their"
KIRK,"Maybe we can avoid another attack. Lieutenant Uhura, open all"
UHURA,All channels open. Translator tied in.
KIRK,This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We wish you no

SCOTT,What?
MIRA,Hold me. It's happening again. No!
SCOTT,Mira.

MIRA,"No, Scotty. No! No."
KIRK,Lock in phaser tracking controls.
KIRK,Adjust phasers to fire across its course. Do not hit it.
SULU,"Locked in, sir."
KIRK,"Fire. Reaction, Mister Sulu?"
SULU,"None, sir. They're still approaching us."
KIRK,Apparently a shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing.
SULU,"Locked in, sir."
KIRK,Fire.
MIRA,Scotty!
SCOTT,Mira! Mira.
SULU,The phasers seem to have stopped their
KIRK,Lock in for another blast.
SULU,"Locked in, sir."
KIRK,Killing Lieutenant Romaine?
SCOTT,"Aye. When you fired the phasers, they"
KIRK,Get her to Sickbay at once.
SULU,"Ready for firing, Captain."
KIRK,Cancel that order. Another attack on that alien life form will

KIRK,"If she is to survive, we can't attack."
SPOCK,Not directly.
KIRK,Can the computer supply a defence based on the data you've been
SPOCK,"Negative, Captain. I have not been able to gather sufficient"
KIRK,And yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects. Captain Kirk to
KIRK,Is the girl well enough to be questioned?
KIRK,Have the Lieutenant and Mister Scott in the briefing room as
MCCOY,"Go easy on her, Jim. She's in a pretty bad"
KIRK,I'll try.
KIRK,Lieutenant Romaine.
MIRA,"I didn't mean to be unco-operative, Doctor."
MCCOY,Of course you didn't. I told the Captain.
KIRK,We must get to understand what is happening.
MIRA,I'll tell you everything I know.
KIRK,Ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new
MIRA,I trust all of you implicitly. I want to help.
KIRK,This investigation has been prompted by two events. First is the
MIRA,You mustn't worry about hurting me.
KIRK,Now this is how we'll proceed. Mister Spock has all the

KIRK,"Mister Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the"
SPOCK,"I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main"
KIRK,"Thank you. Mister Sulu, what is the status of our friends?"
KIRK,"Continue evasive manoeuvres. Keep me informed. Kirk out. Doctor,"
MCCOY,"Yes, Captain."
KIRK,I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked. Any
MCCOY,Occasional and teenage routine incidents.
KIRK,Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities?
MCCOY,None.
KIRK,Any pathological or unusual empathic responses?
MCCOY,"No, Captain, not empathic. However, an extremely flexible and"
KIRK,"Go ahead, Doctor."
MCCOY,"After our phasers hit that thing, I gave Lieutenant Romaine a"
KIRK,Go ahead.
MCCOY,The comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows that
KIRK,That's impossible!
MCCOY,That's what I was taught. But the BCP is just as consistent as
KIRK,Let's see it.
SPOCK,"Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine"
MCCOY,"That's right, Spock. But exceptional pliancy was indicated. That"
SPOCK,And you are sure that this is the correct slide?
MCCOY,"Yes, Mister Spock. That is tape deck D, brain circuitry pattern"
SPOCK,"Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking"
MCCOY,Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way. There can be
KIRK,"Check it, Spock."
SPOCK,"As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the"
COMPUTER,Comparison tape D's brain circuitry patterns of Lieutenant
SPOCK,Fascinating.
MCCOY,There has been no error.
SPOCK,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds"
SULU,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Continue evasive action. Keep me informed. Kirk out.
SCOTT,Mira has tried to tell me all along that she was seeing things
KIRK,Why didn't you report it?
SCOTT,You don't report space sickness. That's all I thought it was.
KIRK,What did she see?
SCOTT,"The first attack on the ship, the attack on Memory Alpha and the"
KIRK,Those were all acts carried out by our attacker.
SCOTT,And? And?
KIRK,"Yes, Scotty? What else?"
SCOTT,"I thought for a moment there was something else, but I guess I"
KIRK,"Was he wrong, Lieutenant?"
MIRA,"Yes, there was one other time."
KIRK,What did you see?
MIRA,I saw Scotty.
KIRK,Where?
MIRA,I don't know.
KIRK,What was he doing?
MIRA,He was dying. Now I understand what's been happening. I've been
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,What success did you have?
SPOCK,"At their present force, they will get through the shields this"
KIRK,"Warp eight, Mister Sulu."
KIRK,They'll be here very soon. They may destroy you and us as they
MIRA,Tell me what to do.
KIRK,Captain Kirk to medical lab.
KIRK,Prepare the antigrav test units. Let's go.
SULU,"Attention. All personnel, attention. Alien"
KIRK,As soon as she has entered the gravity
MIRA,"Don't touch me, Scotty! Stay away."
SCOTT,We've lost her to them.
KIRK,Stay where you are.
MCCOY,She could kill us all in this state.
SPOCK,"She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has"
SCOTT,"Stay with us, Mira. Please stay."
MIRA,I'm trying. I want to be with you. They are too strong.
KIRK,Don't lose yourself to them. Hold on.
MIRA,I am Mira Romaine. I will be who I choose to be. I will. Stay
SCOTT,You won't let them.
ZETAR, She cannot stop us. You cannot prevent it.
SCOTT,Mira. Mira! Captain.
KIRK,That's not Mira talking.
SPOCK,"Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still"
KIRK,I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. Do you
ZETAR,"Yes, we understand you. We have searched for a millennium for"
KIRK,Who are you?
ZETAR,We are from Zetar.
SPOCK,That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was
KIRK,You can't be from Zetar. All life was destroyed there long ago.
ZETAR,"Yes, all corporeal life was destroyed."
KIRK,Then what are you?
ZETAR,"The desires, the hopes, the mind and the will of the last"
KIRK,All things die.
ZETAR,At the proper time. Our planet was dying. We were determined to
KIRK,The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead.
ZETAR,She will accept ours.
KIRK,She will not. She is fighting for her own identity.
ZETAR,Her mind will accept our thoughts. Our lives will be fulfilled.
KIRK,Will she learn the way people on Memory Alpha learned?
ZETAR,We did not wish to kill.
KIRK,But you did kill!
ZETAR,No. Resisting us killed those people. We did not kill them.
KIRK,The price of your survival is too high.
ZETAR,We only want the girl.
KIRK,"You can't have her. You're entitled to your own life, but not"
MIRA,Life was given to me. It is mine. I want to live it out. I will
MCCOY,The girl’s life reading is becoming a match to the Zetarians.
ZETAR,Do not fight us.
SPOCK,They will not accept their own deaths.
KIRK,They'll be forced to accept it.
ZETAR,You will all die.
SPOCK,"Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out"
KIRK,We must get her into the pressure chamber.
MCCOY,"Jim, you realize the pressure needed to kill the Zetars might"
SCOTT,Mira will not kill me.
SCOTT,I told you she wouldn't kill me.
KIRK,Secure the chamber. Neutralise gravity.
MCCOY,The Zetars are growing stronger.
SPOCK,The weightless state has become their natural condition.
KIRK,Pressurise the unit. Bring pressure to two atmospheres and then
MCCOY,"The pressure is dangerously high, Captain. It may damage her."
KIRK,"Continue, Spock."
KIRK,Pressure!
MCCOY,"We've done it, Jim. They're gone."
SCOTT," It's all right, Mira. They're gone. They're gone!"
MCCOY,"Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock."
SPOCK,"We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor."
MCCOY,"Lie perfectly still, Lieutenant. Try not to move at all. Take"
SCOTT,Now we have all the time in the world.
KIRK,"Bones, are you able to judge the long range"
MCCOY,"When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions"
SPOCK,"Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor."
MCCOY,"However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the"
SPOCK,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult"
KIRK,Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a
SPOCK,"You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for"
However MCCOY,"There are no howevers about it, Mister Spock. It was a factor,"
KIRK,Do I take it both of you agree that Lieutenant Romaine need not
MCCOY,"Well, I should think work would be a better therapy."
SPOCK,Logical.
KIRK,Captain Kirk to Mister Scott.
KIRK,"Mister Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine?"
KIRK,"Yes, Mister Scott. Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty?"
KIRK,Thank you. Kirk to Bridge.
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, set course for Memory Alpha. Lieutenant Romaine has"
KIRK,"Well, this is an Enterprise first. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and"
Original Airdate,"14 Feb, 1969"
KIRK,Report.
MCCOY,"Jim, there's a large deposit bearing two seven three, four"
Everybody on board the Enterprisewill SPOCK,"Strange. Readings indicate a life form in the vicinity,"
KIRK,Let's get that ryetalyn.
KIRK,Inoperative.
FLINT,Do not kill.
KIRK,I'm Captain James Kirk
FLINT,I know who you are. I have monitored your ship since it entered
KIRK,"Then if you know who we are, you know why we're here, Mister?"
FLINT,Flint. You will leave my planet.
SPOCK,"Did you say your planet, sir?"
FLINT,"My retreat from the unpleasantness of life on Earth, and the"
KIRK,"Mister Flint, I have a sick crew up there. We can't possibly"
FLINT,"You're trespassing, Captain."
KIRK,"We're in need! We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it."
FLINT,You have nothing I want.
KIRK,"But you have the ryetalyn that we need! If necessary, we'll take"
FLINT,"If you do not leave voluntarily, I have the power to force you"
KIRK,"Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, lock phasers onto our"
KIRK,"Mister Flint, if anything happens to us, four deaths and then my"
FLINT,An interesting test of power. Your enormous forces against mine.
SPOCK,"Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you"
KIRK,We need only a few hours.
MCCOY,Have you ever seen a victim of Rigelian fever? They die in one
FLINT,"Constantinople, summer 1334. It marched through the streets, the"
SPOCK,"Are you a student of history, sir?"
FLINT,"I am. The Enterprise, a plague ship. You have two hours, at the"
KIRK,With all due gratitude.
FLINT,M4 will gather the ryetalyn which you need. 
FLINT,"Come in, gentlemen."
FLINT,My planet is surrounded by screens which create the impression
SPOCK,Then you live here alone.
FLINT,"Except for M4, which serves as butler, housekeeper, gardener and"
KIRK,"A most impressive home, Mister Flint."
MCCOY,"Yes, a Shakespeare first folio. A Gutenberg Bible."
MCCOY,Do we trust him?
SPOCK,It would seem logical to do so for the moment.
MCCOY,"Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into"
KIRK,"If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting,"
SPOCK,This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever
RAYNA,At last I have seen other humans.
FLINT,Other men.
RAYNA,One is not human.
FLINT,The Vulcan.
RAYNA,"Oh, so that is a Vulcan. I would like to discuss sub-dimensional"
FLINT,"Even he is not your intellectual equal, nor mine."
RAYNA,Let me meet them.
FLINT,"They are selfish, brutal, a part of the human community which I"
RAYNA,Soon they will be gone. Let me meet them.
FLINT,Rayna.  Have you been lonely?
RAYNA,What is loneliness?
FLINT,It is thirst. It is a flower dying in the desert.
RAYNA,"Flint, don't take this opportunity away from me. It's so"
FLINT,Exciting? You have never made a demand of me before.
RAYNA,I'm sorry.
FLINT,Do not be sorry. It might be interesting.
MCCOY,"Saurian brandy, one hundred years old. Jim?"
KIRK,Please.
MCCOY,"Mister Spock, I know you won't have one. Heaven forbid those"
SPOCK,"Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy."
MCCOY,Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan? Once
alcohol hits that green blood SPOCK,"If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am"
MCCOY,I'll drink to that. What emotion?
SPOCK,Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued
KIRK,Would be? You mean you think they're fakes?
SPOCK,Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable
KIRK,"Well, this could be what it seems to be, or it could be a cover,"
MCCOY,"Well, that could explain the paintings. Similar to the real"
KIRK,"Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder"
KIRK,"Mister Scott, run a full computer check on Mister Flint and on"
KIRK,Kirk out. Let's enjoy this brandy. It tastes real.
KIRK,Easy. Bones?
MCCOY,"Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin."
KIRK,Beam up to the ship and start processing.
FLINT,"That will not be necessary, Captain. M4 can prepare the ryetalyn"
MCCOY,"I would like to supervise that, of course."
FLINT,"And when you are satisfied as to procedures, I hope you will do"
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Flint. I don't think we have the time."
FLINT,I regret my earlier inhospitality. Let me make amends.
FLINT,"Gentlemen, may I present Rayna."
KIRK,I thought you lived alone.
FLINT,I meant there are no others besides my family. Doctor McCoy.
RAYNA,"Mister Spock, I do hope we can find a moment to discuss field"
SPOCK,Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of
FLINT,Captain Kirk.
RAYNA,Captain Kirk.
KIRK,Rayna.
FLINT,Her parents were killed in an accident while in my employ.
MCCOY,"With most impressive results, sir. What else interests you"
RAYNA,Everything. Less than that is betrayal of the intellect.
MCCOY,The totality of the universe? All knowledge?
FLINT,Rayna possesses the equivalent of seventeen university degrees
MCCOY,"At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage,"
RAYNA,Flint is my teacher. You are the only other men I've ever seen.
MCCOY,"The misfortune of men everywhere, and our privilege."
FLINT,"If you would accompany my robot to the laboratory, Doctor, you"
MCCOY,"Thank you, sir."
FLINT,"Your pleasure, gentlemen. Chess, billiards, conversation?"
KIRK,Why not all three?
KIRK,Did you teach her that?
FLINT,We play often.
RAYNA,"May I show you, Captain?"
KIRK,"You said something about savagery, Mister Flint. When was the"
FLINT,"You would tell me that it is no longer cruel. But it is,"
KIRK,"Thank you. Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive. If"
FLINT,The result of pressures which are not your concern.
KIRK,"Yes, well, those pressures are everywhere in everyone, urging him"
FLINT,"Why don't you play the waltz, Mister Spock? To be human is also"
KIRK,May I have the pleasure?
KIRK,Is something wrong?
MCCOY,"Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good. It"
SPOCK,Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless.
FLINT,Most unfortunate that it was not detected. I shall go with M4 to
MCCOY,Thank you.
KIRK,"Time factor, Bones? Epidemic?"
MCCOY,Nearly two and a half hours. I guess we've got time to get in
KIRK,But would we have made the error?
MCCOY,"Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium?"
KIRK,Go with Flint. Keep an eye on procedures.
MCCOY,Like a hawk.
SPOCK,Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This
KIRK,"Later, Spock."
SPOCK,"Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in"
KIRK,I think I will go to the laboratory. There may be a way of
KIRK,You left us. The room became lonely.
RAYNA,"It is a thirst, a flower dying in the desert."
KIRK,What? What's in there?
RAYNA,I do not know. Flint told me never to enter. He denies me
KIRK,Then why are you here?
RAYNA,"I do not know. I come here when I am troubled, when I would"
KIRK,Are you troubled now?
RAYNA,Yes.
KIRK,By what? Are you happy here with Flint?
RAYNA,"He is the greatest, kindest, wisest man in the galaxy."
KIRK,Then why are you afraid?  Don't be afraid.
RAYNA,Stop command. Stop.
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate"
FLINT,M4 was programmed to defend this household
KIRK,"If it were around right now, it would correct"
FLINT,"Too useful a device to be without, really. I created another. It"
SPOCK,Fascinating.
FLINT,"Be thankful that you did not attack me, Captain. I might have"
KIRK,"In your own words, it would be an interesting test of power."
FLINT,"How childish he is, Rayna. Would you call him brave or a fool?"
RAYNA,I'm glad he did not die.
FLINT,"Of course! Death, when unnecessary, is a tragic thing. Doctor"
KIRK,I don't like the way he orders her around.
SPOCK,"Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn,"
KIRK,He loves her?
SPOCK,Strongly indicated.
KIRK,"Jealousy. Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to"
SPOCK,It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it.
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott.
KIRK,Report on the Rigelian fever.
SCOTT,"Nearly everybody aboard has got it, Captain."
UHURA,There is no report on Mister Flint. He doesn't seem to have any

KIRK,"Kirk out, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,"We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a"
KIRK,"Can you confirm that, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical
KIRK,Time factor.
SPOCK,We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and
KIRK,What's keeping the processing this time?
RAYNA,You sent the robot to kill him.
FLINT,It came to protect you.
RAYNA,My mind could not have summoned it. I was not frightened.
FLINT,"It was defective, then. I would have destroyed it myself. Have I"
RAYNA,Never.
FLINT,Believe what I say. I would not want Captain Kirk dead. What did
RAYNA,You will let them have the ryetalyn?
FLINT,"Yes. Go to them, if you wish. Say your farewells."
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,No award of custody?
SCOTT,No background at all in any computer banks.
KIRK,Kirk out. Like Flint. People without a past.
SPOCK,"Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the"
KIRK,Let's find McCoy.
RAYNA,Captain?
KIRK,I'll meet you in the lab.
RAYNA,I've come to say goodbye.
KIRK,I don't want to say goodbye.
FLINT,"A last tender encounter, Captain Kirk, to end your usefulness."
MCCOY,"I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the"
SPOCK,"Interesting. Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to"
MCCOY,"Well, I think we'd better tell Jim."
SPOCK,The captain wanted us to wait here.
KIRK,Come with me. I offer you happiness.
RAYNA,I've known security here.
KIRK,"Childhood must end. You love me, not Flint."
MCCOY,Flint lied. The ryetalyn isn't here.

IRINA,"Yes. Oh, we should not tear at each other so, Pavel. We should"
IRINA,Are you happy in what you do?
CHEKOV,Yes.
IRINA,Then I accept what you do.
CHEKOV,You even talk like them. Why did you go away?
IRINA,It was you who went.
CHEKOV,I came back to look for you. I looked. Where did you go?
IRINA,"I stayed in the city, with friends."
CHEKOV,You never felt as I did. Never.
IRINA,I did.
CHEKOV,You don't have it in you to feel so much. Even when we were

CHAPEL,I thought all the animals were kept in cages.
KIRK,"What's going on, Bones?"
MCCOY,Trouble. Your friend here didn't want a checkup. Turns out
SEVRIN,I refuse to accept your findings.
MCCOY,You don't have the choice.
SEVRIN,"They're the product of prejudice, not science."
MCCOY,I don't know what this man was planning on doing on a primitive

MCCOY,There wouldn't have been enough primitives left to bury their

MCCOY,I wish it were. There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last
KIRK,Does he have it? What about the others?
MCCOY,All the others are clear. He doesn't have it. He's a carrier.
KIRK,Is the crew in danger?
MCCOY,I don't know. They all had full spectrum immunisations before

MCCOY,"Would you like to run the test, Doctor? You knew you were a"
SEVRIN,No!
MCCOY,Then why did you fight the examination?
SEVRIN,It was an infringement on my rights.
KIRK,Put him in isolation.
MCCOY,"Be ready for the objections, Jim. They are a vocal lot."
KIRK,"Yes, I'm ready. Kirk to Security. I want a guard maintained on"
MCCOY,It'll show in twenty four hours. It's a virulent strain.
WOMAN,You don't belong with them! You know what we want. You want it
SULU,How do you know what I want?
WOMAN,"You're young. Think young, brother!"
SULU,You make it tempting.

SPOCK,Then you knew you were a carrier.
SEVRIN,Of course I knew. You've researched my life. You've read the

SEVRIN,And for that reason I should persuade my friends to behave so
SPOCK,"Yes, Doctor."

SPOCK,"If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be"
ADAM,I'll spread the word.
IRINA,Am I allowed in?
CHEKOV,Yes.
IRINA,"I have been looking for you, Pavel. What room is this?"
CHEKOV,Auxiliary control.
IRINA,What's it for?
CHEKOV,"Should the main control room breakdown or suffer damage, we can"
IRINA,To apologise. I should not have teased you. It was cruel.
CHEKOV,It does not matter.
IRINA,"Oh, but it does. It is against everything I believe in."
CHEKOV,Let us not discuss your beliefs.
IRINA,"And I do not like having you angry with me, or disapproving."
CHEKOV,Then why do you do such things?
IRINA,What are you working on?
CHEKOV,I am assisting Mister Spock in locating your Eden.
IRINA,"Oh, now you are teasing me."
CHEKOV,"I am not. These tapes contain star charts, and we project the"
IRINA,Do you know all these things?
CHEKOV,"What I do not know I find out from the computer banks. If, if I"
IRINA,"They tell you what to do, and you do what they tell you."
CHEKOV,No. We use our own judgment also.
IRINA,I could never obey a computer.
CHEKOV,You could never listen to anyone. You always had to be

SEVRIN,If I am in any way prevented from reaching
KIRK,Can he do it?
SPOCK,"He has the capability, Captain."
KIRK,Start a trace-back of all circuits.
SEVRIN,"Do that, and I shall retaliate."
SULU,"Captain, we're now leaving the Neutral Zone. Bearing into Romulan"
KIRK,Any patrols?
SPOCK,Negative.

KIRK,"If you do not, you will never reach Eden. You"
KIRK,Adam.
KIRK,You are being led by a man who is insane.
KIRK,"Spock, you tell them."
SPOCK,"Adam, there is a file on Doctor Sevrin in our computer banks. In"

ADAM, Ain't that just awful.
SPOCK,You'll also find a report from the same

RAD,"There it is. They've established Eden, Brother Sevrin."
IRINA,Pavel said they would. Our original course must have been
SEVRIN,When will we get there?
RAD,"At this speed, three hours."
SEVRIN,They'll try to persuade us to change course presently and then
RAD,How do you plan to stop them? By cutting off their life support?
SEVRIN,"I have another weapon. Take control, Brother Rad."
ADAM,What are you doing?
SEVRIN,Making an adjustment on their circuits.
ADAM," Headin' out to Eden. Yea, brother. Headin' out to Eden."
SPOCK,We are within sensor range of Eden and
KIRK,"Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do now. We have no"
ADAM,When will you use that?
SEVRIN,At the proper time. Let me know when we're in orbit.
RAD,"Approaching right on the dot, just as they plotted it, Brother"
IRINA,What will that do to them? What is it?
SEVRIN,"Well, I'm using sound against them, beyond the ultrasonic. It"

SPOCK," Captain, go. I. You must destroy the"
KIRK,What is it?
SPOCK,Ultrasonics. The panel.
KIRK,Kirk to Engineering. Bridge? Hangar deck? Kirk to Transporter
and then KIRK,Never mind. Do we have control of the ship?
KIRK,Can we break out of orbit if we have to?
SULU,"I think so, sir."
KIRK,Kirk here.
CREWMAN,"Sir, one of the shuttlecrafts has been taken. We were all"
KIRK,Stand by. Do you read any Romulans?
SPOCK,"Negative, Captain. However I am picking up the shuttlecraft."

KIRK,"No. No, they tried to destroy us. Let them think they succeeded."
SPOCK,"The legends were true, Captain. Fantastically beautiful planet."
CHEKOV,Eden.
KIRK,Is this what they believed they'd find? Then I can understand.
KIRK,What is it?
CHEKOV,"The flower, sir. I touched it. It's like fire."
MCCOY,It's burned. All this plant life is full of acid. Even the

MCCOY,It should for a while.
SPOCK,Captain.

KIRK,We can help you aboard the ship.
SEVRIN,"We're not leaving Eden, none of us."
KIRK,"Be sensible, Doctor."
SEVRIN,We're not leaving.
MCCOY,"Come back here, you fool!"
KIRK,"Sevrin, don't! You'll kill yourself!"
MCCOY,Don't bite into that!
KIRK,Stop!
IRINA,It was so beautiful.
PALMER,"I have Starbase now, Captain."
KIRK,Alert them that we have the four and we're ready to beam them
PALMER,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Bridge to Transporter. Scotty, are they there?"
KIRK,"Stand by. Mister Chekov, do you wish to attend?"
CHEKOV,"Captain, I wish first to apologise for my conduct during this"
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Chekov. You did what you had to do. As did we"
CHEKOV,"Thank you, sir."
CHEKOV,I was coming to say goodbye.
IRINA,"And I was coming to say goodbye to you.  Be incorrect,"
CHEKOV,And you be correct.
IRINA,Occasionally.

UHURA,"Captain, the High Advisor of Ardana is ready to receive you on"
KIRK,"On Stratos? That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"It is, Captain."
KIRK,There must be some mistake. Do you have the co-ordinates to the

KIRK,Kirk to transporter room.
KIRK,"Mister Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their"
SCOTT,"The mine entrance. That's what you ordered, Captain."
KIRK,Fine. Uhura. Tell the High Advisor that we request to dispense
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Spock, come with me. Oh, and tell them that we appreciate"
UHURA,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,"Stratos, Captain. A city actually floating in the sky."
KIRK,"Looks as tranquil as its reputation, doesn't it."
SPOCK,It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy.
KIRK,Once. I didn't have time to look around.
SPOCK,"I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms"
KIRK,"Yes, art is the population's chief occupation."
SPOCK,It is a totally intellectual society. All forms of violence have

KIRK,Perhaps.
SPOCK,It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about

VANNA," Interference breeds attack, Captain. Come on!"
KIRK,We're here by permission of your government council on an
VANNA,"Move on, Captain!."
PLASUS,"Troglytes, halt!"
PLASUS,Surrender or we'll fire!
PLASUS,"Are you harmed, gentlemen?"
KIRK,"No, just a little shaken up."
PLASUS,"I'm Plasus, High Advisor of the planet council."
KIRK,"Captain Kirk, Enterprise. My first officer, Mister Spock."
SPOCK,"Greetings, Mister Advisor."
PLASUS,My regrets for the unpleasantness of your welcome to Ardana.
KIRK,It was rather warm.
PLASUS,"Unfortunately, violence is habitual with the Troglytes. But I"
KIRK,"Well, I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment. Why wasn't"
PLASUS,"Apparently the Disrupters have confiscated it, as I knew they"
SPOCK,The Disrupters? Who are they?
PLASUS,A small group of Troglyte malcontents. All the other Troglytes
KIRK,They agreed to the delivery. Your council assured us of it.
PLASUS,They agreed obviously as a ruse to get valuable hostages.
KIRK,Hostages? For what purpose?
PLASUS,To force the council to meet their demands. 
PLASUS,"Meanwhile, Captain, I would suggest that you and First Officer"
KIRK,"Very well. I do hope the search will be brief, Mister Advisor."
PLASUS,"We'll do everything possible to make it so. Come, gentlemen."
SPOCK,Remarkable. The finest example of sustained antigravity
DROXINE,"The sentinel told me of our honoured guests, my father. I came"
PLASUS,A most gracious act. One of our planet's most incomparable

DROXINE,"Indeed, yes, Captain."
PLASUS,And First Officer Spock.
DROXINE,"I have never before met a Vulcan, sir."
SPOCK,"Nor I a work of art, madam."
PLASUS,"Come, gentlemen. There is much to see in our city. This is our"
PLASUS,Disrupters again.
DROXINE,How dreadful!. They're despoiling the whole city.
SPOCK,Despoil? For what purpose?
PLASUS,"By keeping us in constant turmoil, they hope to force the"
KIRK,What are their demands?
PLASUS,"Completely unreasonable, Captain, but nothing you need be"
KIRK,I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the
SPOCK,"Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that"
PLASUS,"I assure you, gentlemen, you will get what you came for."
KIRK,"I hope so. Ardana is a member of the Federation, and it is your"
PLASUS,"Of course, and we accept the responsibility."
SPOCK,But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone.
PLASUS,Art means nothing to the Disrupters. This  is the
SPOCK,"That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor."
PLASUS,Chambers have been prepared for you. A sentinel will guide you
DROXINE,I'm sorry they were so poorly treated on their first visit to
PLASUS,It's fortunate that they were not seriously hurt.
DROXINE,"Oh, yes, that would have been dreadful."
PLASUS,Further violence could create grave difficulties between Ardana
DROXINE,The Disrupters must be mad to attack two such charming

PLASUS,Remove his shields.
PLASUS,"What is your business in Stratos, Troglyte? Speak! I command"
TROGLYTE,My business is to repair.
PLASUS,Repair what?
TROGLYTE,There are damaged entrance panels.
PLASUS,Indeed. Then you must have a repair permit. Where is it?
TROGLYTE,It was forgotten.
PLASUS,Did you also forget your transport card?
TROGLYTE,It was lost when your sentinels attacked me.
PLASUS,And where was your cavern implement lost? Could this perhaps be
TROGLYTE,I came to make repairs.
PLASUS,And you shall make them by giving us the names of the
TROGLYTE,I know nothing.
PLASUS,I would advise you to increase your knowledge.
TROGLYTE,That is not possible for a Troglyte. The Stratos city
PLASUS,Secure him to the rostrum.
PLASUS,How unfortunate. How unfortunate.
DROXINE,"Mister Spock, I thought you had accompanied Captain Kirk to"
SPOCK,Your movements awakened me.
DROXINE,My apologies. I did not realise they would disturb you.
SPOCK,Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible.
DROXINE,It seems that Vulcans are fascinatingly different in many
SPOCK,The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants.
DROXINE,"Vulcan eyes are very discerning too. I hear that,"
SPOCK,We do pride ourselves on our logic.
KIRK,You again!
VANNA,"You sleep lightly, Captain."
KIRK,"Yes, duty is a good teacher. I see you've changed your"
VANNA,Release me.
KIRK,So you can attack me again? That would be foolish.
VANNA,"Call the guards if you’re afraid, Captain."
KIRK,"I'm not afraid. In fact, I find this rather enjoyable."
VANNA,I do not!
KIRK,"All right, I'll make a deal with you. You answer some questions"
VANNA,What questions?
KIRK,Your word first.
VANNA,I will answer.
DROXINE,You only take a mate once every seven years?
SPOCK,The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcan’s.
DROXINE,"And is there nothing that can disturb that cycle, Mister"
SPOCK,"Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam."
VANNA,"I did not come here to kill you, Captain."
KIRK,Then why this?
VANNA,To take you hostage.
SPOCK,"Am I intruding, Captain?"
DROXINE,Vanna!
VANNA,Droxine.
DROXINE,Why have you come here?
VANNA,To welcome our honoured guests as I was taught to do when I

KIRK,"No, not at all. In fact her visit was quite enlightening."
DROXINE,Oh?
KIRK,"Yes, it seems the Troglytes are under the impression that the"
DROXINE, Send a sentinel to the rest chamber
VANNA,"It is not impression, Captain. It is the truth."
KIRK,"We're here to get that zenite consignment, and that's it."
VANNA,Starships do not transport cargo.
KIRK,"In times of emergency, they do anything. And believe me, this"
VANNA,"Lies will not keep the Troglytes in the caverns, and neither"
DROXINE,"You talk like a Disrupter, Vanna."
VANNA,I speak for my people. They have as much right to the clouds as
DROXINE,But Stratos is for advisors and studiers. What would Troglytes
VANNA,"Live in the sunlight and warmth, as everyone should."
DROXINE,The caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to
KIRK,Unaccustomed to light and warmth? That's necessary to all
DROXINE,"The Troglytes are workers, Captain. Oh surely, you must be"
SPOCK,"In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to"
DROXINE,That is their function in our society.
SPOCK,But they are not allowed to share its advantages.
DROXINE,How can they share what they do not understand?
KIRK,"They can be taught to understand, especially in a society that"

VANNA,There are no Disrupters!
PLASUS,"Very well, if you prefer the rays."
SPOCK,Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term. Its
KIRK,"Yes, I should have realised."
KIRK,Mister Advisor!
KIRK,"You said you were going to question Vanna, not torture her."
PLASUS,"She's stubborn, and as you yourself pointed out, Captain, the"
KIRK,Surely there are better methods than this.
PLASUS,"Physical discomfort is extremely persuasive, Captain."
KIRK,"Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured!"
PLASUS,Is it preferable to spare Vanna and allow an entire planet to
SPOCK,"Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not,"
DROXINE,"But what else can they understand, Mister Spock?"
SPOCK,"All the little things you and I understand and expect from life,"
PLASUS,"Troglytes are not like Stratos dwellers, Mister Spock. They're"
KIRK,The abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to
PLASUS,A few Troglytes are brought here as retainers. Vanna was one of
KIRK,But obviously no more consideration.
PLASUS,I fail to see the purpose of this continued criticism.
KIRK,The only way you'll use that device again is on one of us.
PLASUS,"An imposing display of primitive gallantry, gentlemen. You"
KIRK,"Of course, but Starfleet command won't take kindly to having"
PLASUS,Why are you so concerned with this Disrupter's well-being?
KIRK,"Beyond plain humanitarianism, my orders are to get that zenite."
PLASUS,"Then stop interfering, and I'll get it for you."
KIRK,You won't get it through torture.
PLASUS,"We will get it for you, and in our own way. Remove the prisoner"
KIRK,Kirk to Enterprise.
KIRK,"Mister Scott, we're ready to beam up."
PLASUS," If Captain Kirk appears again, kill him."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Uhura, advise Starfleet command"

KIRK,Natural growths? What kind?
MCCOY,Well. I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface. Now
SPOCK,Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there
MCCOY,"There are none after it’s refined. But in its raw state, it"
KIRK,And the mines are full of that gas.
MCCOY,That's right. And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to

SPOCK,"As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure"
MCCOY,"That's right, Spock. The other Disrupters were probably removed"
KIRK,Does the brain return to normal?
MCCOY,"According to findings, it should."
KIRK,Can you neutralise the gas?
MCCOY,"No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure."
KIRK,Find one. Meet us in the transporter room.
KIRK,This mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to

KIRK,"I am here to get that zenite. If these will help me get them,"
KIRK,My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate.
MCCOY,It's pretty hard to overcome prejudice.

SPOCK,Nor much time. We have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver
KIRK,Beam me down to Vanna's confinement quarters.
MCCOY,You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders?

KIRK,"Vanna, I've brought you a gift. There's a dangerous gas in the"

KIRK,Yes.
VANNA,It's hard to believe something which is neither seen nor felt
KIRK,That's true. But an idea can't be seen or felt. That's what's
VANNA,Would all the Troglytes wear these masks?
KIRK,Yes. I'll see to it that the Federation engineers construct them.
VANNA,Suppose Plasus does not agree?
KIRK,Plasus is not the whole government.
VANNA,"That is true, but the city council will not listen to Troglytes."
KIRK,"As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak Two, I'll come back."
VANNA,"Centuries ago, Stratos was built by leaders that gave their word"
KIRK,The zenite can be delivered in a few hours. You won't have long
VANNA,"Hours can be centuries, just as words can be lies."
KIRK,"Vanna, you must trust me. If you don't, millions of people will"
VANNA,"Very well, Captain. I will trust you. The consignment lies deep"
VANNA,It's the sentinel with my refreshment.
VANNA,Wait. We'll need a transport pass to leave the city.
VANNA,Midro.
MIDRO,Vanna.
VANNA,Anka.
ANKA,You have returned.
VANNA,And I've brought with me a hostage. Seize him!
KIRK, We had a bargain. Why did you break it?
VANNA,"Did you really think I would trust you, Captain? I'm not such a"
KIRK,I trusted you.
VANNA,You thought you would trick me with your talk of your filter and
KIRK,"Then you are a fool. These masks will free you, just as I said."
VANNA,Our weapons are our freedom. And you’ve just furnished me with
KIRK,Holding me won't help you. My men'll still come for that zenite
VANNA,"Without your communicator, you will be hard to locate."
KIRK,They'll still come.
VANNA,"Perhaps. In the meantime, a taste of our existence, Captain. Dig"
KIRK,"Without that mask, I haven't"
VANNA,"With your bare hands, Captain."
VANNA,"You dig well, Captain. The unseen gas"
KIRK,It takes a while for its effects to be noticed.
VANNA,"Nevertheless, you won't be needing this. Anka, deposit this on"
ANKA,"You are clever, Vanna. Very clever."
VANNA,"Searchers will be coming soon, Midro. Go to the other mines and"
MIDRO,What of him?
VANNA,I will see that he doesn't escape.
MIDRO,"If we kill him, there will be no need to see."
VANNA,"A dead hostage is of no value, Midro."
MIDRO,Only the Troglytes will know.
VANNA,I brought him here and I will say what is to be done.
MIDRO,"You are not the only Disrupter. I, too, can say."
VANNA,Can you do nothing but argue? The searchers will be here soon.
MIDRO,"When Anka returns, we will all say."
KIRK,"Is that what Disrupters are bargaining for, the right to kill"
VANNA,Midro is a child.
KIRK,The masks can change that.
VANNA,"Return to the digging, Captain."
KIRK,"How long do you plan on keeping me here, providing Midro doesn't"
VANNA,Until we have help in the mines and our homes are in the clouds.
KIRK,That's quite a while. Longer than I expected.
VANNA,We're sealed in!
KIRK,Completely.
VANNA,But soon the atmosphere will go. We'll die.
KIRK,"Die from something that can't be seen? You astound me, Vanna."
KIRK,Nothing. Are you locked in on me?
SPOCK,Locked in and ready to beam up consignment.
KIRK,"Circumstances dictate a slight variation,"
SPOCK,Standing by for instructions.
KIRK,Hold on these co-ordinates. Locate the High

SCOTT,"Beam the High Advisor down without warning,"
SPOCK,"That's not an exact quote, Mister Scott. However, it does"
SCOTT,I'd like to see the Advisor's face.
SPOCK,You will have that opportunity.
SCOTT,"The captain did say immediately, did he not?"
SPOCK,"Now that is an exact quote, Mister Scott, and I suggest you"
SCOTT,Aye.
PLASUS,"Something's upsetting you, Droxine."
DROXINE,"No, Father."
PLASUS,What is it? Tell me.
DROXINE,"No, really. I'm not upset. I was just standing here looking"
PLASUS,He will never return. I've seen to that.
DROXINE,But the zenite is so important to him. He must have it.
PLASUS,"It will be delivered. If we have to kill every Troglyte, it"
DROXINE,"By that time, it may be too late. Perhaps he does have a"

SPOCK,"Until the High Advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain"
DROXINE,"No, I wasn't thinking of Captain Kirk."
PLASUS,"Oh, he's no better than his friend."
DROXINE,Shall we try?
PLASUS,What is it?
SENTINEL,The Disrupter Vanna has disappeared. Her guard was found half
PLASUS,Where is Captain Kirk?
SENTINEL,"He did not know, sir. He did not regain his senses until I"
PLASUS,This is the kind of reason they use to persuade us.
DROXINE,They are desperate.
PLASUS,I will hear no more defence of them.
DROXINE,I'm sure Mister Spock would not behave so.
PLASUS,Leave here at once. Go to your music.
DROXINE,"Father, are we so sure of our methods that we never question"
SPOCK,Spock to transporter room.
SPOCK,Lock in on Council Gallery co-ordinates.
SPOCK,Energise.
SCOTT,Energising.
SPOCK,"How are you doing, Mister Scott?"
SCOTT,"Fine, Mister Spock. The High Advisor's"
SPOCK,Beam him down to Captain Kirk immediately.
SPOCK,"Good work, Mister Scott."
SPOCK,The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm.
PLASUS,Abduction of a planet official is a serious
KIRK,"Not until you're convinced of the effects of the zenite gas,"
PLASUS,What effects? I've been here nearly an hour of your Earth time.
KIRK,Perhaps you need closer exposure. Fill that container.
PLASUS,Are you suggesting that I dig zenite?
KIRK,I insist.
PLASUS,You will indeed pay for this.
KIRK,"You too, Vanna. You too! Dig! Kirk here. What is it?"
SPOCK,"Contact check, Captain. It has been over an"
KIRK,"Your orders are to stand by. Now, carry them"
SPOCK,"Standing by, Captain."
SPOCK,That is very unlike the captain.
MCCOY,Can the zenite be affecting him?
VANNA,I grow faint. The oxygen is going.
PLASUS,"She's right. Kirk, transport us out of here."
KIRK,We'll leave when the gas has effect.
PLASUS,It will never take effect. Transport us out of here!
KIRK,Dig!
PLASUS,Imbecile! We'll die!
KIRK,I said dig!
PLASUS,I am High Advisor of all the planet. I will take no more
KIRK,One more step and I'll kill you.
VANNA,"The gas! Captain, you were right. It's taking effect! Captain,"
PLASUS,Are you as brave with mortae as you are with a phaser?
KIRK,Both will kill.
VANNA,"Enterprise! Enterprise, help! Enterprise!"
SPOCK,"Enterprise, Spock here."
VANNA,Help us! Enterprise!
SPOCK,"Captain, the zenite gas has affected you. Captain! The zenite"
KIRK,The zenite gas.
MCCOY,"Look out, Jim!"
KIRK,"Well, it seems my little demonstration was quite a success."
DROXINE,"I don't like filters, or even masks. I"
SPOCK,"It is less technical, therefore less accurate, but perhaps more"
PLASUS,It appears you have what you came for after all.
VANNA,"The captain will have his zenite, just as I agreed."
PLASUS,Agreed? There's no such word in the Troglyte vocabulary.
VANNA,The captain will have his zenite.
PLASUS,No thanks to any agreement by you. It had to be obtained by
VANNA,Because it is the only way we can obtain what is due us.
PLASUS,How about your education? Was that by force?
VANNA,It served your purpose at the time.
PLASUS,You could have had those filters for all the good it will do
KIRK,"They will be very effective. sir. They've been severely tested,"
PLASUS,"They will all be like her. ungrateful, vindictive."
VANNA,"Yes. Our demands have just begun. Here is the zenite, Captain,"
KIRK,"Thank you, Vanna."

SCOTT,"Locked on to something. Does that appear human to you, Mister"
SPOCK,"Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like"
SCOTT,"We can beam it aboard anytime now, sir."

KIRK,"Yes, of course he's an alien."

SPOCK,"No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there"
KIRK,"Why Lincoln, Spock? Any speculation on that?"
SPOCK,"Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear."
KIRK,"But not only to me, Spock."
SPOCK,"Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work"

SCOTT,Aye!

KIRK,"Standing by, Mister Scott."
SCOTT,Transporter room to bridge. Standing by.

KAHLESS,Yes.
GREEN,What did you find out? What are they doing?
KAHLESS,They've done nothing. They've not armed themselves nor

KAHLESS,Better than what they have.
GREEN,"No, it's not advantage enough. I want to make sure the odds are"

KIRK,We'll use this as a base. It's defensible. They can't approach
LINCOLN,"Are we fighting a defensive war, James?"
KIRK,"No, we don't have time. But if things go against us, I want a"
LINCOLN,Do you drink whiskey?
KIRK,Occasionally. Why?
LINCOLN,Because you have qualities very much like those of another man
KIRK,"Thank you. Thank you. Mister Spock, we'll need weapons. I believe"
SPOCK,"Yes, Captain."
KIRK,And slings and spears. Slings. Mister President. You used a sling
LINCOLN,Indeed I did.
SPOCK,Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course.
KIRK,"We don't have much time, Spock."
SURAK,"In my time on Vulcan, we also faced these same alternatives."
KIRK,"Circumstances were different then, Surak."
SURAK,"The face of war has never changed, Captain. Surely it is more"
KIRK,I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here.
SURAK,That is precisely why we should not fight.
KIRK,My ship is at stake.
SURAK,"I will not harm others, Captain."
SPOCK,"His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain."
KIRK,"So are mine, Spock. If I believed that there was a peaceful way"
out of this SURAK,"The risk will be mine alone. If I fail, you lose nothing. After"
SPOCK,The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will
KIRK,You saw how treacherously they acted.
SURAK,"Oh, yes. But perhaps it's our belief in peace that is actually"
KIRK,I have no authority over you. You may do as you think best.
SURAK,Thank you. May you live long and prosper.
KIRK,"The weapons, gentlemen. In case he fails."
KAHLESS,Colonel!
GREEN,No. Let's hear what he has to say. We may find it useful. Stop
SURAK,I come in peace to propose peace.
GREEN,Are you surrendering?
KAHLESS,"One of those peace lovers, Colonel."
GREEN,Why are you doing this? Do you speak for the others?
SURAK,"No, I speak for myself because I abhor violence. But if you"
GREEN,How can I believe that? No one talks peace
SURAK,He talks peace if it is the only way to live.
GREEN,"Then tell me, what do you have to gain if we accept?"
SURAK,Nothing but the knowledge that I have done what I believe in.
GREEN,"What do I get out of it? I fight for gain, Vulcan. What do I"
SURAK,"Your life and the lives of the others. You said yourself,"
KAHLESS,Why don't we kill him?
GREEN,No. He's our means to finish them all.
SURAK,"Colonel, surely you accept the logic of this. What is your"
GREEN,"You're very persuasive, Vulcan. I'd like to come out of this"
KIRK,Your Surak is a brave man.
SURAK,"Men of peace usually are, Captain. On Vulcan, he is revered as"
KIRK,"You show emotion, Spock."
SPOCK,I deeply respect what he has accomplished.
KIRK,"I hope he accomplishes something here, and soon."
KIRK,Surak?
SPOCK,"They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain. They expect"
KIRK,"Yes, I know that."
SPOCK,He was aware of what might happen when he went.
KIRK,I should never have let him go.
SPOCK,"You had no choice, Captain. You could not have stopped him."
KIRK,How can you ignore that?
SPOCK,A Vulcan would not cry out so.
KIRK,"Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony."
SPOCK,"I am not insensitive to it, Captain."
KIRK,But you can just listen to it and do nothing. I can't.
SPOCK,"Captain, that is what they are waiting for. They're waiting for"
KIRK,I can’t just let him stay there.
LINCOLN,"Perhaps we can rescue him, Mister Spock. Now, I suggest that"
KIRK,"Do what they want, sir?"
LINCOLN,"Not the way they want it, however. We must first convince them"
KIRK,And what will you do?
LINCOLN,"Why, slip into their camp and free him."
KIRK,No.
LINCOLN,"James, James. Remember, I was something of a backwoodsman. I"
KIRK,"I can't let you risk it, Mister President."
LINCOLN,"I am no longer president. Mister Spock, any comment?"
SPOCK,"No, sir."
LINCOLN,"One matter further, gentlemen. We fight on their level. With"
KIRK,"Your campaign, Mister President."
GREEN,They should be coming soon.
GREEN,"Zora! Kahless! No, wait!"
GREEN,How many do you see?
KAHLESS,Two.
GREEN,Zora.
LINCOLN,Surak.
LINCOLN,"Surak, the others have drawn them away. We will circle around."
KAHLESS," Help me, Spock. Help me, Spock."
GREEN,Now can you cry like Lincoln?
KAHLESS," Help me, Kirk. Help me, Kirk!"
KIRK,Mister Lincoln!
LINCOLN,"James, stay back."
ROCK,You are the survivors. The others have run off. It would seem
KIRK,You established the methods and the goals.
ROCK,For you to use as you chose.
KIRK,What did you offer the others if they won?
ROCK,What they wanted most. Power.
KIRK,You offered me the lives of my crew.
ROCK,I perceive you have won their lives.
KIRK,How many others have you done this to? What gives you the right
ROCK,The same right that brought you here. The need to know new
KIRK,We came in peace.
ROCK,And you may go in peace.

KIRK,"Mister Scott, report."
SCOTT,"The ship is functioning normally again, sir, and the restart"
KIRK,Mister Sulu.
SULU,"We should be on warp power within thirty minutes, sir."
KIRK,Good. Mister Chekov.
CHEKOV,The deterioration in the shielding has stopped and is reversing
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Chekov. Mister Spock, any explanation?"
SPOCK,"Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation."
KIRK,Well?
SPOCK,It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able
KIRK,"They seemed so real. And to me, especially Mister Lincoln. I feel"
SPOCK,"Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain."
KIRK,It was so hard for me to see him die again. I feel I understand

ATOZ,May I help you? You may select from more than twenty thousand
KIRK,What about recent history?
ATOZ,"Really? Oh, that's too bad. We have so little on recent history."
KIRK,"It doesn't have to be extensive, Just the answers to a few"
ATOZ,Of course. Reference services available at the desk.
ATOZ,You're very late. Where have you been?
KIRK,"You're a very agile man, Mister Atoz. Just how many of you are"
SPOCK,"Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Our"

KIRK,Of course. I am the real Mister Atoz.

ATOZ,"Now, if these won't do, I can bring you another file."
ATOZ,"Have you made your selection, sir?"
SPOCK,Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select?
ATOZ,I'm sure I was clear. The period in which you're interested.
SPOCK,I see. This is a fascinating machine. What is it?
ATOZ,"Ah, this is the atavachron."
SPOCK,Interesting nomenclature. How does it work? May I

KIRK,What's that? Are you all right?
WENCH,"Oh, I took you to be an angler, but you're none of us, are ya?"
KIRK,You better come back with me to the library. You'll be safe
WENCH,"I'm game, love. Lead and I'll follow. Where's library?"
KIRK,It's right over there.
MCCOY,"Where's the captain, Spock? We were right"
WENCH,"What's with you, man? Let's make off before"
KIRK,No. Do you remember when you first saw me? Do you remember
WENCH,"Oh, I think the rum gull must've kicked you in the head. Come"
KIRK,No. No. It must be here someplace.
MCCOY,"Jim, can you hear us?"
KIRK,Bones? Spock?
SPOCK,"Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you."
KIRK,We must've missed each other somehow.
SPOCK,Apparently they've all escaped the
WENCH,Mercy on us. It's spirits.
KIRK,"No, no. No, no, no. These are friends of mine, and they're"
SPOCK,Indeed not. We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics.

SPOCK,"There is no library, Captain, at least not"

LAW,"We are the law, and do require that you yield to us."
KIRK,On what charge?
LAW,Thievery and purse cutting.
KIRK,That's a mistake. I'm no thief.
LAW,Lord help us. What's that?
WENCH,It's spirits.
LAW,"Away. Away, spirit, and let honest men approach."
KIRK,Keep talking!
MAN,They speak at his bidding. Stop his mouth and they'll quiet.
MCCOY,"Jim, what's the matter? Jim sounded like he"
SPOCK,We may be in trouble ourselves. We must find shelter.
SPOCK,"In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer."
MCCOY,"Leave me here, Spock."
SPOCK,We go together or not at all.
MCCOY,Don't be a fool. My hands and face are frostbitten. I can't feel
SPOCK,We go together.

KIRK,It's called Earth.
JUDGE,I know no island Earth. No matter. Continue.
KIRK,"I never saw that woman before tonight. When she screamed, as far"

LAW,"Aye, my lord. I'll witness to it."
KIRK,"What he heard, my lord, were only my friends behind the wall in"

JUDGE,I know of no Atoz.
KIRK,Yes! Yes! Atoz!

SPOCK,"McCoy. McCoy, wake up."
MCCOY,Who are you?
ZARABETH,My name is Zarabeth.
MCCOY,"Zarabeth. Spock, are we in the library?"
SPOCK,"No, we are still in the Ice Age, but safe for the moment."
MCCOY,Jim. What about Jim?
SPOCK,"Doctor, you're in no condition to get up. You lie down and rest."
MCCOY,"You find him, Spock. Don't you worry about me. You just find"
ZARABETH,"Spock, who is this Jim?"
SPOCK,He's our commanding officer and our friend.
ZARABETH,I saw only the two of you. I did not know there was another.
SPOCK,He did not come with us. He was sent through the time portal to
ZARABETH,But your friend. He is ill.
SPOCK,"Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may never"
ZARABETH,You make it sound like an equation.
SPOCK,It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this

MCCOY, Spock? Where are we?
ZARABETH,"You are safe here, McCoy."
MCCOY,"Yes, I remember you."
SPOCK,"Come, Doctor, back to bed."
MCCOY,"Why are you still here, Spock? Why aren't you looking for Jim?"
SPOCK,"It is impossible to look for him, Doctor. We cannot go back."
MCCOY,What do you mean impossible? We've got to get back.
SPOCK,Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time

SPOCK,Really?
ZARABETH,It’s something to look forward to. I think you must be well
MCCOY,"No, not yet."
ZARABETH,"At your rate of progress, it will be soon, I can see."
SPOCK,Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress.
MCCOY,And Mister Spock has been practicing medicine without a license.
SPOCK,And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the

SPOCK,Five thousand years in the future.
MCCOY,Thank you.
MCCOY,I wonder where Jim is.
SPOCK,"Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is."
MCCOY,"What do you mean, we can only hope? Haven't you done anything"
SPOCK,What was there to do?
MCCOY,Locate the portal. It can't be too far.
SPOCK,"We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of"
MCCOY,"Yes, that was clear to me."
SPOCK,Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back
MCCOY,"I don't believe it, Spock. It’s just not like you to give up"
SPOCK,Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We
MCCOY,"Yes, I understand. I never thought I'd hear it, but I"
SPOCK,The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.
MCCOY,"You listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan."
SPOCK,"I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure."
MCCOY,"What's happening to you, Spock?"
SPOCK,Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago.
MCCOY,Long ago. Of course. Long ago.
JUDGE,This is where it is. I can't remember the exact spot.
JUDGE,That's it! That is the portal. I cannot wait any longer.
KIRK,Spock? McCoy? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.

ATOZ,I am the real Atoz. You've done away with my replicas. I regret
KIRK,"You don't really want to hurt me, do you? You've been trying to"
ZARABETH,I cannot pretend to be sorry that you are
SPOCK,I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time.
ZARABETH,It's not that I wish to return. This is my time now. I've had
SPOCK,Yes. I know what it is like.
ZARABETH,"I believe you do. Have something to eat, please."
SPOCK,If it pleases you. This is animal flesh?
ZARABETH,"There's not much else to eat around here, I'm afraid."
SPOCK,"Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in"
ZARABETH,There's an underground hot spring.
SPOCK,Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of

KIRK,"Now, you're going to help me look for my friends."
ATOZ,You're a most determined man.
KIRK,Kirk here.
KIRK,No time to explain. Are you ready to warp out?
KIRK,"Stand by to beam us up. But when that star explodes, don't wait."
ATOZ,"All right, all right. All right! It must be the Sarpeidon Ice"
KIRK,"We'll both look, Mister Atoz."
MCCOY,"Spock. You've been dishonest with me, Spock,"
SPOCK,"I've given you the facts, Doctor."
MCCOY,The facts as you know them. Or did you just accept Zarabeth's
SPOCK,"You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what"
MCCOY,Zarabeth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness.
ZARABETH,I told you what I know.

MCCOY,She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness. She
SPOCK,What are you doing to her?
MCCOY,"Are you trying to kill me, Spock? Is that what you really want?"
SPOCK,This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan.
MCCOY,The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another five thousand years.
SPOCK,My ancestors are barbarians. Warlike barbarians.
MCCOY,"Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions. Spock,"
SPOCK,I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back?
ZARABETH,I don't know. I only know that I can't go back.
MCCOY,"I know I'm going to try, Spock, because my life is back there,"
ATOZ,Do you think that's the right one?
KIRK,I don’t know.
ATOZ,"If we’re to get the portal set for the proper time period, you"
KIRK,I didn't see it.
ATOZ,Well try calling out.
KIRK,Bones? Spock! McCoy! You've got the wrong one.
ATOZ,"Please, there's no time left. Let me go."
KIRK,Try again.
SPOCK,"There's no portal here, Doctor. It's hopeless."
MCCOY,I suppose you're right.
SPOCK,You're too ill to remain out here any longer. Give it up.
KIRK,Bones. Spock!
MCCOY,"It’s Jim! Here we are, Jim."
KIRK,I've found them. Can you still hear me?
KIRK,Follow my voice.
SPOCK,This must be it.
KIRK,What are you waiting for? Hurry!
MCCOY,"Come on, Spock."
SPOCK,"You start ahead, Doctor. I do not wish to part from you."
ZARABETH,"I cannot come. If I go back, I will die."
KIRK,What are you waiting for? Hurry!
SPOCK,How much time do we have?
KIRK,"Scotty, how much time is there?"
MCCOY,"Come on, Spock, now!"
MCCOY,Something's wrong.
KIRK,What's the matter? Why can't he get through?
ATOZ,"I don't know. Unless, it's because they originally went through"
KIRK,"Spock, McCoy, you can't get through unless you both come back at"
KIRK,No! Wait!
KIRK,He had his escape planned. I'm glad he made it. Kirk to

MCCOY,"But it did happen, Spock."
SPOCK,"Yes, it happened. But that was five thousand years ago. And she"
KIRK,"Scotty, are you there?"
KIRK,Beam us aboard and go to maximum warp as soon as we're there.
Original Airdate,"3 Jun, 1969"
KIRK,What's wrong with her?
COLEMAN,Exposure to radiation.
MCCOY,What form of radiation was it?
COLEMAN,Nothing I've ever encountered.
KIRK,"Janice, you must remain absolutely quiet. Those are doctor's"
SPOCK,Captain. Tricorder picking up very faint life readings.
MCCOY,Perhaps your presence will quiet her.
JANICE,I hoped I wouldn't see you again.
KIRK,I don't blame you.
JANICE,The year we were together at Starfleet is the only time in my
KIRK,I never stopped you from going on with your space work.
JANICE,Your world of starship captains doesn't admit women. It isn't
KIRK,"No, it isn't. And you punished and tortured me because of it."
JANICE,I loved you. We could've roamed among the stars.
KIRK,We'd have killed each other.
JANICE,It might have been better.
KIRK,"You had your chance, Captain Kirk. You should've smothered the"
KIRK,"Doctor McCoy, your report."
MCCOY,"We were too late, Jim. There's nothing could be done."
KIRK,Was it radiation as suggested?
MCCOY,"No, I believe it was celebium. However, Doctor Coleman"
To be specific is essential because the treatment ofcelebium is quite COLEMAN,Doctor McCoy.
MCCOY,Did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone?
KIRK,"No, nothing at all. She was unconscious all of the time."
COLEMAN,Doctor Lester is near death.
KIRK,Perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part

MCCOY,Beaming her up to the Enterprise will be less harmful than

MCCOY,"No, not entirely. We both agree it's radiation. Doctor Coleman"
KIRK,Will it affect your arriving at a correct treatment?
MCCOY,It's crucial.
KIRK,"Well, this is especially disturbing to me for personal reasons."
MCCOY,Oh? I didn't know you knew her that well.
KIRK,"Oh, yes. It's been a long time since I saw her. I walked out on"
MCCOY,"Well, you must have been very young at the time, Jim."

MCCOY,I didn't realise that. I shall do everything in my power.
KIRK,Thank you. Thank you very much.
SCOTT,Doctor Lester is certainly a very lucky young person to have
KIRK,"Yes, very lucky. Very lucky."
COLEMAN,It just began.
KIRK,Well you'd better put a stop to it! If you allow Doctor Lester to
COLEMAN,Probably no one will believe it.
KIRK,Probably?
COLEMAN,That's all we can ask for. How can death be explained now?
KIRK,I tell you it can't continue.
COLEMAN,You killed every one of the staff. You sent them where you
KIRK,There wasn't enough time.
COLEMAN,I gave you every minute you asked for.
KIRK,He hung onto life too hard. I couldn't
COLEMAN,You couldn't because you love him. You want me to be his
KIRK,Love? Him? I love the life he led. The power of a starship
COLEMAN,I won't become a murderer.
KIRK,You are a murderer! You knew it was celebium. You could've
MCCOY,"Jim, what are you doing here?"
KIRK,I thought my presence might quiet Doctor Lester. It seems to have
COLEMAN,It has nothing to do with you. It's a symptom of the

KIRK,Didn't Doctor Lester's staff become delirious before they went
COLEMAN,"Yes, Captain. Yes."
MCCOY,Doctor Lester could be suffering from a phaser stun as far as
KIRK,"Doctor Coleman, Doctor McCoy has had a great deal of experience"
COLEMAN,Doctor Lester and her staff have been under my supervision for
KIRK,"Doctor McCoy, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to take you off"
MCCOY,You can't do this! On this ship my medical authority is final!
KIRK,Doctor Coleman wants to assume the full responsibility. Let him
MCCOY,I won't allow it.
KIRK,"It's done! Doctor Coleman, your patient. Doctor Coleman, didn't"
COLEMAN,"Yes, Captain."
MCCOY,"It's not necessary, Jim. Can't you see she's coming around?"
KIRK,Doctor Coleman.
COLEMAN,"Nurse, administer the sedative."
MCCOY,"A sedative is not wise at this time, Captain."
COLEMAN,"Nurse Chapel, you have your orders."
MCCOY,"Nurse Chapel, follow your instructions."
JANICE,"Oh no. Am I really losing command of the Enterprise? No. Oh,"
KIRK,"Course, Mister Chekov."
CHEKOV,One two seven mark eight.
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, set speed at warp factor two."
SULU,"Warp factor two, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Chekov, plot a course for the Benecia Colony."
CHEKOV,"Direct course to Benecia, three seven three mark eight."
KIRK,How long to the colony at our present speed?
CHEKOV,"Forty-eight hours, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Sulu, set course for the colony. Three seven three mark"
SULU,"Aye, sir. Three seven three mark eight."
SPOCK,"Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae. It means"
KIRK,"Yes, it can't be helped. We must take Doctor Lester to a place"
SPOCK,May I point out that Starbase Two is on the direct route to our
KIRK,How long to Starbase Two?
CHEKOV,"Seventy two hours, Captain."
KIRK,It's twenty four hours too long. Doctor Lester's condition is
SULU,"Aye, sir."
SPOCK,If the diagnosis of Doctor Lester's illness is the critical
KIRK,They will have to serve.
SPOCK,Starbase Two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary
KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock, but the facilities will be of little use"
SPOCK,"At maximum speed, Starbase Two would still meet the emergency."
LYSA,"Captain, shall I advise Starfleet Command of the change of plan?"
KIRK,"No change of plan has been ordered, Lieutenant. Our arrival at"
SPOCK,"Sir, I believe Starfleet will have to be notified that our"
KIRK,"Mister Spock, if you’d concentrate on the areas for which you are"
SPOCK,"Since the captain usually deals with Starfleet in these matters,"
KIRK,"Inform Starfleet of the delay, Lieutenant."
LYSA,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,Continue present course. Increase speed to warp factor six.
MCCOY,I'll let my record speak for me.
KIRK,Why are you being so defensive? There's no implied criticism of
MCCOY,That is not the reason I'm here. I'm here because Doctor
KIRK,That's the opinion of an individual.
MCCOY,"No, sir. That is the opinion of Starfleet Command. I checked"
KIRK,There are no administrative duties required here.
MCCOY,As well as flagrant medical blunders.
KIRK,Promotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred. You know
MCCOY,"Not in Starfleet Headquarters, Captain. And certainly not in the"
KIRK,I'm afraid the order will have to stand. I can only say that
MCCOY,I appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make. I also
KIRK,What? What do you base that on?
MCCOY,Development of emotional instability and erratic mental
KIRK,You'll never make that charge stick. Any fool can see why you're
MCCOY,I'll let Starfleet Command be the judge of my motives.
KIRK,I won't submit to this petty search for revenge!
MCCOY,"But you will submit to Starfleet regulations, and they state"
KIRK,Captain Kirk here.
SULU,"Sulu here, Captain. Starfleet Command is requesting additional"
KIRK,I'll be right there.
JANICE,"Pulse, pressure, blood count, all body functions normal. Then"
JANICE,Doctor McCoy? Doctor McCoy
COLEMAN,Quiet would be best for you.
JANICE,Where's Doctor McCoy?
COLEMAN,I'm in charge now.
JANICE,Bring Doctor McCoy at once! He is in command of medicine on
COLEMAN,He was taken off your case by Captain Kirk.
JANICE,By Captain Kirk?
COLEMAN,"It was done for your own protection, Doctor Lester."
JANICE,I am not Janice Lester! She did this to me! Now how can I make
JANICE,Nurse Chapel. Bring Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy to me at
COLEMAN,She is suffering from the delusion of being Captain Kirk.
JANICE,I am not Janice Lester!
COLEMAN,The paranoia has been developing for the past six months. The
CHAPEL,"Shall prepare a mild sedative, Doctor?"
COLEMAN,Of course.
COLEMAN,"You are insane, Doctor Lester."
JANICE,I must've sounded quite mad to you before.
CHAPEL,What you've been through would've completely broken most of us.
JANICE,"Well, I'll be all right now. Could I see your Doctor McCoy?"
CHAPEL,I'm afraid that's against Doctor Coleman's orders.
JANICE,Oh. Is a visit by that very kind Mister Spock to be allowed?
CHAPEL,Perhaps that can be arranged before we reach the Benecia
JANICE,The Benecia Colony? But isn't the Enterprise going to
CHAPEL,"Well, first we have to let you recuperate at Benecia. (offering"
JANICE,"Well, I'll try. Thank you. Oh, it is good. Thank you. Could I"
CHAPEL,Well
JANICE,I promise I'll be good.
CHAPEL,"Well, I'll be right back. I'm glad you're feeling so much"
MCCOY,These tests should help me pinpoint the
SPOCK,Good. Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading
MCCOY,"Yes, well what worries me most is that Jim seems completely"
SPOCK,"I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor. The illness appears"
MCCOY,One of us should be able to get to him. I keep looking for an
SPOCK,Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted.
MCCOY,"You know headquarters, Spock. They're only interested in results"
SPOCK,Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his
MCCOY,I'll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary.
SPOCK,"Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground. Actions such as"
MCCOY,"Well, then, so be it. Our responsibility is clear."
SPOCK,Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must've taken
MCCOY,"Well, it's worth a try. Why don't you try to get to Doctor"
KIRK,"Well, gentlemen. I'm here, Doctor."
JANICE,Spock. Bones. Help me. Don't let them lock me away from you.
MCCOY,Jim!
KIRK,She might have killed someone.
KIRK,Put her in isolation in her room. Maintain a twenty four hour
GALLOWAY,"Yes, sir."
MCCOY,Captain.
SPOCK,How is the doctor?
GALLOWAY,She regained consciousness very quickly.
SPOCK,Good. I have questions to ask her.
GALLOWAY,"Did the captain order it, sir?"
SPOCK,"Why should he? They are my questions, therefore I am ordering"
GALLOWAY,The captain said no one is allowed to speak to Doctor Lester.
SPOCK,Has such an order ever included his senior officers?
GALLOWAY,"No, sir. Mister Spock, I think the captain meant that a guard"
SPOCK,"By all means, Lieutenant."
MCCOY,"That's enough. That's enough. Your heart will last forever,"
KIRK,How am I otherwise?
MCCOY,"In the pink, as usual. Liver, kidney, blood count, metabolic"
KIRK,Good. I hope you're as pleased about it as I am.
MCCOY,Don't get dressed yet.
KIRK,You said I was in perfect condition.
MCCOY,Physically.
KIRK,I don't think another test is necessary.
MCCOY,The Robbiani dermal-optic is crucial. It reveals the basic
SPOCK,Complete life-entity transfer with the aid
JANICE,"Yes, that's what it must've been."
SPOCK,"To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished"
JANICE,It was accomplished and forgotten long ago on Camus Two. I am a
SPOCK,"That is your claim. As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any"
JANICE,"Nevertheless, Spock, it is the truth I'm speaking."
MCCOY,Now lower your arms and open your eyes.
SPOCK,At this moment Doctor McCoy is examining the
JANICE,"Spock, when I was caught in the interspace of the  Tholian"
SPOCK,"That is true. The captain did not. However, those events have"
JANICE,You are closer to the captain than anyone in the universe. You
SPOCK,"I believe you. However, my belief is not acceptable evidence."
GALLOWAY,"I’m sorry, sir, but Doctor Lester cannot leave here."
KIRK,"Well, are you satisfied with the results of"
MCCOY,There is no positive evidence of any disorder.
GALLOWAY,You're asking me to violate the captain's
SPOCK,He is not the captain.
GALLOWAY,You're as mad as she is. You're to leave here at once. I
SPOCK,"Certainly, Lieutenant. We all must do our duty."
GALLOWAY,Security guard!
KIRK,"No hard feelings, Bones. You did your usual thorough, good job."
MCCOY,I'm sure everything's going to be all right.
KIRK,Captain Kirk here.
KIRK,Captain Kirk to Security. On the double to Doctor Lester's room!
SPOCK,"It's quite all right, Ensign. Everything is"
KIRK,Phasers.
SPOCK,"A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir."
KIRK,"Attention, all personnel. First Officer Spock has been placed"
SCOTT,Surely you must have more than that to go on.
SPOCK,I have stated my evidence. Telepathic communication with the
SCOTT,Your evidence is completely subjective. We have to have evidence
SPOCK,"You've had great deal of evidence, except that of the chief"
KIRK,She's dangerously insane. We've seen the evidence.
SPOCK,"She is dangerous only to your authority, sir."
KIRK,"Mister Spock. Mister Spock, my authority has been given to me by"
SPOCK,"The witness, sir. Bring on the witness. Let your officers put"
KIRK,"Mister Lemli, have Doctor Janice Lester brought here."
LEMLI,"Aye, sir."
KIRK,"Doctor McCoy, while Mister Spock was busy with his ambitious"
MCCOY,Examining you.
KIRK,"Oh, yes. You were deeply concerned about my health, emotional and"
MCCOY,"Yes, that's correct."
KIRK,"Instead of trying to destroy me, you were searching for ways to"
MCCOY,The captain is in the best of physical condition. His emotional
KIRK,"Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock, were you aware of Doctor"
SPOCK,I know them now.
KIRK,And what have you to say now?
SPOCK,I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no
KIRK,"Doctor Coleman, if you’re required here, we'll call you."
KIRK,We certainly appreciate your being here. Everyone is deeply aware
JANICE,No. I am not Captain Kirk. That is very apparent. I claim that
KIRK,"Oh. Well. However, as I understand it, I am Doctor Janice Lester."
JANICE,"That's very clever, but I didn't say it. I said, the body of"
KIRK,A subtlety that somehow escapes me. I assume that this switch was
JANICE,No. It was brought about by a violent attack by Doctor Lester
KIRK,"Violence by the lady, perpetrated on Captain Kirk? I ask the"
JANICE,"Yes. To get the power she craved, to attain a position she"
KIRK,Are you prepared with witnesses? One will do.
SPOCK,"Sir, there is only one issue here. Is the story of life-entity"
KIRK,"Mister Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by"
SPOCK,"Not precisely, no."
KIRK,"Oh. Assuming that you are correct in your belief, do you expect"
SPOCK,I expect only to reveal the truth.
KIRK,"And with the truth revealed, that I am not really the captain,"
SPOCK,And what will become of Doctor Lester?
KIRK,Doctor Lester will be cared for always. It is a debt and a
SPOCK,"No, sir. I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made."
KIRK,"Lieutenant Lysa, play back those last two sentences from Mister"
KIRK,You heard the statements placed into the record by you. Do you
SPOCK,I do. And I stand by it.
KIRK," It is mutiny! Deliberate, vindictive, insane"
SPOCK,"Yes, sir. An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left"
KIRK,Silence. You will be silent! A recess has been declared. There
MCCOY,Scotty.
SCOTT,"Doctor. Doctor, I've seen the captain feverish, sick, drunk,"
MCCOY,I've been through this with Spock. He's not being scientific and
SCOTT,"It may not be scientific, but if Mister Spock thinks it"
MCCOY,Don't you think I know that? My tests show there's nothing wrong
SCOTT,"Headquarters has its problems, and we have ours. And right now,"
MCCOY,I don't know.
SCOTT,"Aye, you know, all right. It'll stick in his craw. He'll never"
MCCOY,We don't know that.
SCOTT,"I tell you, he won't. Then, Doctor, that's the time we move"
MCCOY,"We're talking about mutiny, Scotty."
SCOTT,Aye. Are you ready for the vote?
MCCOY,Yes. I'm ready for the vote.
KIRK,Play the tapes of the conversation in the
LYSA,"Aye, sir."
MCCOY,That's enough. We know what was said.
KIRK,Enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers. And you're so
CHEKOV,Starfleet expressly forbids the death penalty.
KIRK,All my senior officers turning against me?
SULU,The death penalty is forbidden. There's only one exception.
CHEKOV,General Order Four. It has not been violated by any officer on
KIRK,I am responsible. The execution will be immediate. Go to your
KIRK,"Mister Lemli, take them to the brig. Prepare for execution. Go"
SULU,The captain really must be going mad if he
CHEKOV,Captain Kirk wouldn't order an execution even if he were going
SULU,What difference does it make who he is? Are we going to allow an
CHEKOV,"If security backs him up, how will we fight him?"
SULU,I'll fight them every way and any way I can.
KIRK,"Lieutenant Lysa, inform all sectors of my decision. Have each"
CHEKOV,Coming within scanning range.
KIRK,"Plot co-ordinates for orbit. Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates"
KIRK,You have received your orders! You will obey my orders. You’ll be
JANICE,"For a moment, I thought that I was up on"
SPOCK,Perhaps you were.
MCCOY,Then it's possible the transference can be broken.
JANICE,"Well, if it happens again, I'll fight to stay there."
SCOTT,The bridge is where you belong.
SPOCK,"To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any"
KIRK,"Arthur, the transference is weakening."
COLEMAN,What happened?
KIRK,"For a moment, I found myself back with the prisoners. I will not"
COLEMAN,The only way to prevent the transference is by the death of
KIRK,I can't. I can't. The crew is in mutiny. You must kill her for
COLEMAN,I have done everything else for you. But I will not murder for
KIRK,"Then do it for yourself. If Kirk doesn't die, we'll both be"
KIRK,The dosage should be doubly lethal.
COLEMAN,It is.
KIRK,"To prevent further conspiracy, you will be removed to separate"
SPOCK,"May I point out, Captain"
KIRK,Kill him! Kill him!
JANICE,Ohh! I've lost to the captain. I've lost to James Kirk! I want
COLEMAN,"You are, you are as I loved you."
JANICE,Kill him.
KIRK,Can you do anything for her?
COLEMAN,I'd like to take care of her.
MCCOY,Of course. Come with me.
KIRK,I didn't want to destroy her.
SPOCK,"I'm sure we all understand that, Captain."
KIRK,"Her life could have been as rich as any woman's, if only. If"

# MrSpock: A Discord bot that is highly logical 

Mr Spock is one of science fiction's most loved characters. He was originally introduced in Star Trek: The Original Series as far back as 1966. His influence on pop culture is significant to this day, with modern characters like Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory and Sherlock Holmes from BBC's Sherlock still quoting him to this day. Vulcans were introduced as alien beings who are highly logical and extremely philosophical in nature. The idea is to build a chatbot based on one of my favorite characters of all time, as we could all use a little dose of cold, Vulcan logic every now and then.
